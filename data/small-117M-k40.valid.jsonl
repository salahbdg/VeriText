It is so different than my usual book reviews and a lot of the reviews are bad. It's all about making money. I'm looking for support, I know it's hard to get a book like this made or read, but my wife was interested in this book and I was happy and glad she was getting one of my books.\n\nIn this issue of Our Book, I'll provide a look at how we funded the project on Kickstarter. You can learn how we got started and who helped us get started. The first thing I want to point out is that we have to be able to afford it. We already have a website and bookshop. So what do we do with it, or if we would be willing to give it away? We sell books by our side for free! As of this writing, We've raised just over $150,000. With that money, we will continue to fund these projects in a way that we wouldn't have if we weren't so eager to keep doing what we're doing now. So you should check out My Book Shop and get yours now before it's too late!\n\nI also want to touch on the story of how I came to be writing this book. How did you decide to write the first one, what was it about you that intrigued you?\n\nI was writing this book because I wanted to keep working on that. A few years ago, when I was 14, a guy named Mark (who you all know) got a book called I Want To Be an American Boy. This book was an all-star team, and it helped that I was a young kid who'd never known the world in any other way. I had no idea that I was interested in literature. Then you look at my early 20's, there was a very large amount of writing in school about the art world, and a great many people in the field talked about how great writers and artists were. I looked at my parents and siblings and I think people would say that was the best book to write. That was my first foray into the hobby and, yes, it made for a very interesting reading experience for me. And that book inspired me to get into painting, I think painting made me realize that the world we live in is not so simple that we just see each other every day. I was looking to learn how to paint and my family decided to go and show them painting for school and I really enjoyed it.\n\nHow did you find what you want to do with your book, and how did you find your inspiration?\n\nThe story that inspired my book is pretty much just that: what my dad did for me and the life that got me interested in it. I had this story about a kid who just passed away from cancer; his parents had no money and he went to college, and we were living in Los Angeles. In college, he read poetry; we started a poetry project together. The teacher there asked for a book about poets, and all the poems came out, he loved it, he liked it. That's just because he could draw on the poetry and I enjoyed going to the library. He saw how poetry can bring out the rich in us and he loved the idea of poetry, and when I told him I wanted to see how poetry could expand to other people they were like, \"That's why I don't know anybody who's been in a poem of this caliber.\" You can understand the excitement of that. When I was 14 he just sent me to the library to show me how to paint and he did what he was going to do to me, and I took a picture of his masterpiece, just because I was interested in it. It was one of those things where you get the idea of a painting, as far as being interested, it is something that you can put pictures on. It is a very beautiful way to paint and it is my story that inspired and shaped this book. I'm working on this idea again so I have to give everyone the benefit of the doubt here. I know there will be changes if I keep doing this, but I have a lot to give them. I can give them a few thousand dollars and hopefully, they'll keep talking back to their parents and not the school. I am also going to give all our support and I will give back to help people to come out and to take the book to their local bookstore where I have a little bit of a copy of it and write something for their kids to look at and have it read. It's great to read something that you've never touched before and I think that's something that I will never forget.", "length": 989, "ended": true}

She said she believes she was the victim in this attack. She also identified her son as his sister, who said she \"never thought anything would happen to him.\"\n\nLoyola was ranked as one of the top colleges in the country by the National Alliance for Educational and Service Technology Research and in 2013 was ranked the No. 1 U.S. high school and second-best in school outcomes.\n\nBut the school has faced calls from students calling it out in a social media campaign that has targeted its own campus-wide media profile since the attack. On Saturday an unidentified student wrote: \"Loyola is a place where you should be ashamed, not ashamed of yourself. We are going to help you if you are going to help our city.\"\n\nMorris also was a \"social media savvy student\" who shared a map of the state of his state on her social media page and also posted photos from his classroom where he worked in the classroom before and after the attack.\n\nThe Facebook post came six days after UCLA University sophomore Stephen Harper \u2014 who also attended the school \u2014 wrote that at 5:30 p.m. Sunday the same day the incident occurred, \"Loyola is known as one of the safest student-teachings in the nation.\"\n\nMorris, along with her son Daniel, graduated from Loyola in 2009.

I just don't think we should have to do both,' said the mother of 11-year-old Kia Farkas, who was stabbed to death in a robbery in London this week, as police searched an area where the stabbing took place. She refused to have her two children run away from the attack. 'I'd rather keep my home and stay away from my family,' she said. 'I don't really want to be in that position.' She said the family had planned their attack, with Farkas wearing a t-shirt reading 'Help Us Save Ya Dad', along with some items of clothing for children of their home owners. The mother said police had been alerted about the incident before the incident and had made a \"significant number of arrests.\" The man is wanted on suspicion of trying to commit the stabbing. A friend of the family had asked police to arrest the man after spotting a t-shirt with Farkas and items of clothing for children belonging to the family. Police said the attack happened after the man told them they knew he was in contact with two of their neighbours and that one of them had seen another man stab Farkas. Police said they had contacted the man about two weeks ago and had contacted him again over the weekend after receiving the call, as well as the message from the TPD which stated he would not make the same attempt to kill himself. The father of one of a number of people who are believed to be involved in the stabbing said it \"seemed more like a selfless act of care\" during a visit to Kensington Palace on Monday. 'As the incident is being investigated, our detectives have contacted the families of the victims of the knifeman and identified those involved,' said the mother of one of the victims, who told reporters that police had not informed her parents of the alleged robbery. Police said the man had been seen leaving a property when he attacked the young man with a knife. The attack happened at around 3pm local time, at the same time that a man was stabbed in the back by a male of the same surname shortly before midnight. Pictured: CCTV footage of what appears to be a 'selfless act of care' During the attack police were on patrol before 4.30pm at the scene because of fears the suspects could attack any group that approached them. Pictured: As people were being treated for the fatal attack police rushed people to areas close to the crime scene in the City of Kensington. Officers said a man who was wearing a t-shirt saying \"Help Us Save Ya Dad\" and some clothing for kids had been spotted, but could be located on CCTV footage. Pictured: Officers are on hand to help with the search of the area near the Tops Road station which was closed to traffic during the attack Two witnesses who were called from nearby Manchester said they saw the suspect in police car, possibly carrying a knife. They said they heard the man shout 'help, we don't know what's going on'. The police are appealing for any information they may have about the man. Police are concerned about a number of other attacks after the attack, including the stabbing of a 12-year-old boy in a pub in Manchester in October 2015. Two people died and four others were injured as police tried to tackle the terror cell in which Islamic State militants tried to attack Manchester United from a restaurant in the North End. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the bombing in Paris. Police officers were called about three hours after the attack because someone wearing a t-shirt that said \"Help Us Save Ya Dad\" had a knife when they arrived on scene. Police believe the attacker was wearing black and his face covered with a blue shirt. A second resident said the man on the left had a t-shirt with the message, \"Help Us Save Ya Dad\", but on either side was a shirt saying, \"Help us\". Another victim at a nearby restaurant later told the paper: \"I was thinking why would [Islamic State] throw a knife at me when they are carrying out similar attacks all over the world?\" It has been reported that Islamic State fighters have carried out at least 30 bombings in Iraq and Syria so far this year, with one of the casualties being the death of an RAF pilot at RAF Lycoming in November.

It should be noted that these videos were made without video editing or editing software. Here's the entire article:\n\nAs for what is wrong with one post and what is really wrong with the others, it's time to stop making videos. This is not about censorship. We all make mistakes. What's wrong with a video is an excuse to do something for the other person. When a video criticizes you because you are too lazy, you just need to stop doing that.\n\n- A \"Video review\" would just have you stop saying shit on forums and Facebook. When you are being called on your actions (like using a \"proper name\") you have to change them.\n\n- A video is made for the purpose of saying something. If some one can't understand what you really mean, then it is not going to end the way you want it to and you have no choice but to leave.\n\n- To start with, people can only get the things they want. And that means that if you want to say something, you don't have to spend 20 hours a day writing to someone. If you want to have people respond to your story, then people need to respond because they need to know exactly what they are saying to other people and if you are going to do that, then please stop making videos where people need to know exactly who you are and what you want.\n\n- If a person will respond with words and pictures or pictures that they feel are offensive, then it just means that the people who do not feel safe to speak with are saying bad things to you. They just want you to stop doing what they want you to do.\n\n- Make sure everyone knows this. People are afraid to talk about things so you don't. Also, when people say things that are hurtful or damaging then you just have to stop speaking.\n\n- You don't have to make sure that every person is completely safe. Also, if you are making a film about something but the other person is making it more explicit, then you only have to make sure that every person is completely safe to make the video in the first place.\n\n- The reason why we make videos is so that people come to the internet and enjoy the information and to help one another. It is only if the people that you create create the videos that will actually be helpful to each others.\n\n- We all get along. If you're the type of person who likes to discuss stuff with people in other places, then you are much more likely to understand what is being said.\n\n- If in your work, for example an award winner is having that conversation, it is very likely that they all know the words and photos people post to other people and what they are going on about. So your job is much more to help them when this conversation happens.\n\n- One key thing people are really good at when it comes to sharing the news is to always have your friend and family around so that people know who you are.\n\n- If all you do are just talking in this place, then you'll be more likely to get along.\n\n- When you have the friends around, they will want to know where you are.\n\nVideo reviews: How to make videos that will help you gain media coverage or fame\n\n- A video review makes you stand on something and it's not a bad thing. If you write something that people like and you want them to know about it, then you shouldn't get involved in any way as long as it feels good.\n\n- A video review will get people to want to do it. People who want to hear about your work, who want it to be better if someone does, or who want you to try something new for them.\n\n- A video review means it's an opportunity for people to learn about you.\n\nWhat is a video review? A review is not a review of what you wrote and what you didn't write. A video review is not a review of a review. A review is simply what was discussed at the time of publishing. A statement written by a user about what is happening on the system.\n\nA review should be a statement about what you wrote, what you didn't write, what was going on or the experience with other people involved. A statement about your writing or actions and a list of things your work has brought to the table to help them achieve this.\n\nWhen you post a video review, it will be your video or your video review. If you don't have your video, then it will be a video review by a friend. People will want to know how you are doing.\n\nA video review is when people give you an update about how they think of you or how they know that you do", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

The basic pattern of food usually consists of a doughnut, a layer of sugar, and a doughnut shell. You can make a variety of dabs of different kinds using different doughnut shell shapes and types.\n\nHow doughnuts are made Edit\n\nDumplings Edit\n\nDumplings are made from flour, eggs, yeast, or a mixture of many substances. Generally these contain:\n\nFlour (bake bread for bread; flour into a doughnut)\n\n- yeast\n\n- egg\n\nFruit\n\n- sugar - all made from\n\nDye (fruits are made by eating and chewing them together in different steps).\n\nDuck: a traditional Japanese term for the fruit, commonly found in rice cakes, in which it is cut into small holes, or into small pieces (usually of equal size). A duck has about a 4:1 ratio of protein to fat in total. The duck is most often eaten when it's cooked with milk and honey.\n\nSugar: the starch in your diet.\n\n- egg\n\n- sugar\n\n- fruit (a fruit is a small animal, such as a duck or a squirrel)\n\n- protein\n\n- protein\n\n- fat\n\n- eggs\n\n- fat\n\n- sugar - the main purpose of most of these foods, and which is to bring protein from the animal into the human diet\n\nSugar in food - it's called a fat in other words, that is what its use in protein foods is. In addition to sugar, it is also a strong food in that it is hard to digest and is high in carbohydrates. It consists of three main sugar components - the sugar as fat (a fat), the sugar as the egg, and the sugar as the sugar of the duck, and the sugar as fat as egg.\n\nSo what about those 3 components of the doughnut are they? We can see that they're essentially the same as doughnuts:\n\nFlour - the mixture of flour, egg, sugar, vegetable oil, and fish meal\n\n- yeast\n\n- egg\n\n- egg\n\n- fish meal - egg with the yeast\n\n- sugar - sugar\n\n- protein\n\n- fat The more flour, the more it's protein, which in this case are the three fatty components, or components that are similar when they are added to food. Fruits are called ginseng.\n\n- starch in food - the main substance in fruit soup\n\n- fat\n\n- protein\n\n- fat sugar - fats are used in almost every protein food such as flour\n\n- sugar in the dumpling [\n\nIt's important to notice that these three components take the form of sugars. What we're going to see is that they all take the form of a solid \"g\" called starch. There are about 20 to 30 different types of sugar in a dumpling\n\nGinseng contains about 50% to 45% of sugar and half of that sugar comes from vegetables, fruits and grains. These components all get mixed together in a small bowl to give ginseng the characteristic shape: grain. The grains are made of different types (such as rice, beans, peas) and in combination, they all add a similar amount of sugar.\n\nThe dumpling may only be made with 1,000 mg of sugar per serving\n\nGinseng is a food of great nutritional value and an interesting addition to any diet. It's important to note that some foods have a higher sugar content so if you want a different diet, you should try making ginseng first.\n\nI'll use about 1/16 of a teaspoon, because it can be a lot at once. A teaspoon of sesame seeds would do nicely.\n\nFruit\n\nGinseng contains about 17 times more sugar than sugar does\n\nFruits are great in small amounts such as peas, corn, etc. It's a nice addition to most recipes.\n\nWhat are ginseng's main qualities Edit\n\nIt's important to note that the two main ingredients are sugar, a fat, and fish meal (or \"fishmeal\"). The ginseng can vary greatly from one piece of the recipe to the next so you can tweak the amount that you want. In other words, the ginseng needs to have a similar amount of calories or fat to make it good. Ginseng is a good choice if you want the fishmeal as it contains the most calories and only slightly heavier sugar than fishmeal; however, there is no reason you can't make the fishmeal with your own ingredients for the sake of flavor.\n\nSugar content of ginseng on the scale above\n\nThe ginseng is a good source of sugar content", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

Among them:\n\nGiving in excess of $50 million to a candidate would have prohibited disclosure of certain information about the contributions to candidates. The company would then be required by federal law to tell the public about the amount, if any, that would have been covered under the disclosure form, which was first published in August 2014.\n\nThe state's disclosure requirements required that the donations be disclosed in a publicly available public forum, which was \"open to all.\"\n\nThere is no requirement that such contributions are not made publicly, but an inspector general's office was allowed to examine the company and its tax filings for any irregularities.\n\nIn 2016, the state gave $300,000 to two political action committees, including the Minnesota State Treasurer's Campaign Finance Center, which runs a nonpartisan nonprofit. The money received amounted to less than $40,000 from three different donors.\n\nIn the last year, an audit of the company by local Republicans \u2014 including a group that collected more than $100,000 from $50 million raised in its 2016 election campaign \u2014 concluded that the company gave $35.1 million in donations to political committees.\n\nRep. Mike Tocciaro, D-St. Paul, said the decision could put state political leaders in the shoes of Republican Party officials.\n\n\"I think the party needs to get people on board with this whole thing and find out who the people who are paying these kinds of big bucks for these kinds of contributions are,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats have sued the state since its 2012-2016 efforts in the November election to eliminate the requirement for disclosing campaign contributions. The party wants the disclosure laws extended to party committees, and has said the Republican-run Minnesota Legislative Development Association was given a tax break that could have allowed the state to avoid releasing the records of more than its $200 million in donations. The group also said it had sued state officials at the time for withholding the returns on records obtained for the state's election audits.", "length": 491, "ended": true}

The recording was first recorded in a studio in Melbourne with John Taylor and later on by Frank O'Donnell. The song's first album was recorded on an 18\" LZ44 tape and then played in the Voodoo Studio studio. The band's second album was not produced until late 2000, but did begin its followup album, in 2003.\n\nGinger also recorded the intro to 'Dance with Love' on a Roland Vocal, recorded the 'Chorus' track from the third album with Timo M\u00f8ller and recorded the song 'My Love, O Love, Momma' on a 16\" Roland Vocal. 'Dance with Love' was released on November 15th, 2004, after the band had won a record deal. Their third album, in late 2007, was released on October 12th, after the band had won a record deal.\n\nGinger is well known as a singer and songwriter for her album, 'Love with Joy'. One of the only songs written on her first recording ever was the track 'I'm So, So Glad'. It is the theme song of her other full-length album 'We Are Yours'.\n\nGinger was a dancer who was known as 'Piss, Poissy' during her youth. She attended the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee when she spent about an hour a night dancing in the studio, her dancing teacher in the 'Mansion' at the time. Ginger first heard the song at the University of Wisconsin-Mercer on a 12\" Roland Vocal in 1983, and during her time at the school she was on a daily diet and dancing during the day. She also shared a studio with friends on the same year, 'My Loveshaft'. When she met her boyfriend, Roger, who worked as a dancer and would have been working for the 'Mansion' at the time, she became interested in music.\n\n\nIn 1997, before her first dance performance with Roger and her brother in the 'Piss, Poissy', Ginger was released on her first album, 'A Love Story', and on her second album she released her first album 'Love of Joy'. She shared her debut studio album with her boyfriend and her brother of nine years, Roger, in 2005 and released her fifth studio album, 'A Love Story'.\n\nAfter recording her album 'Love with Joy', she performed as a lead song only at an acoustic version of the 'Dance with Love' recording sessions. The group released five additional studio albums on three separate occasions. During the final five studio sessions, she was only given a single version of \"Happiness\", which was performed by Nick Boffetta, who played along to 'Love and Mercy'. In this special recording session, she was never seen performing live. Following the release of her second studio album, 'Love With Joy', she sang a song that appeared on a live recording and was not shown live at the time of it release. In the recording sessions following the release of 'Luxury', she used the same 'Couples' arrangement as she did on 'Love With Joy' to take the vocals back to the band's later recording session.\n\nIn 1996, the band signed to Record Store Day Records. Ginger recorded 'Ginger' in 1997, 'Love With Joy' on a 17\" LZ44 tape, and 'A Love Story' on a 16\" LZ44 tape. This album included the 'Ginger-Shapes' and 'The Love Between Me, My Brother And The Other One' from the 'Love with Joy' album which was released on 12 February, 1997, when the band had to put out an alternative record due to its release date. The title track of this record is 'The Love Between Me', which was subsequently rerecorded in April 2001. Since the release of 'Love with Joy', the band has performed with 'Love With Joy' four times and the three 'Piss' sessions, 'A Love Story' was performed again. She later played in a live version of 'Luxury' on November 19th in the UK. Her solo album, 'She's the Best One in Love', was a four song series including the recording of \"Love With Joy/The Love Between Me, My Brother And the Other One' on the Lix, the \"She's the Best One In Love\" remix, and the 'She's the Best One in Love' album. The group recorded an acoustic version of the song and on the same night Ginger's friends and producers were on holiday in London with Roger to play 'Piss, Poissy'.

I want to talk with my kids and help them do their math.'\"\n\nThe couple began their relationship as they waited to find out who was doing all the math. They found out one day that a friend of the couple worked as a professor at Princeton. That friend told James that she had a problem with his math. \"The professor said, 'We are going to have to do something big to fix it,' \" the couple recounts.\n\nThey knew the teacher who suggested the experiment. She told them: \"It's important we learn in school. A lot of math comes by accident; it doesn't happen for everybody, but you are going to need to learn it in order to be successful, as well as the math you were taught.\"\n\nShe then offered their friend advice. \"What if I don't know everything there is to know?\" they wrote. \"What if this isn't true? How will we cope with the fact that there are people making money off these kinds of math programs? What if I are working with a bunch of students and one of them will just tell me that I am not a good math teacher?\"\n\nIt didn't take long for James and his parents to come together. She asked them to take off their shoes that day to prove they were smart. In her words, \"What is this? Why can't we make some sense of it?\" She even promised to give them a copy of The Great Uncomfortable Math Test, which James asked for. And he got her to do so on this one task because it was an easy one.\n\nThat led to even more math problems, and when the couple decided to go along with the experiment, she found that the school offered help.\n\nOver the years, The New York Times has covered this project before. So when James and his family got a call saying the program was working with their daughter, \"I thought they were gonna go through with it,\" they knew the plan.\n\nThey wanted the program to go to their child so they could take the test. \"You have to write a statement in the school report saying, 'Yes, this is how the program works,' \" James says. \"That's what it's all about.\"\n\nBut when James asked them, \"How many minutes can we take before the student is asked to say yes?\" they agreed to do that and did so. \"He said I could only give them 45 to 50 minutes,\" the couple says.\n\nWhen James was 15, he decided to test the idea and make it happen. He found that the math test helped them cope with school math. \"Because now you can go and test the idea that there's no real magic,\" James says. \"You can look at the program and know if it'll work or not, and they can put you in their classroom and get back out there to see it.\"\n\n\n\"I had a lot of fun with this project. I had always wanted to do an all hands on deck project with my kids,\" says Jamie.\n\nFor the few kids there, The New York Times found some fun.\n\n\"And the teachers were great,\" the couple says. \"I love how the kids treated them.\"\n\n\nAs Jamie is getting ready for college, she remembers telling her first mom, \"If you think you can do this in six minutes, you are gonna fail. And if you don't think you can do it in six minutes, you need to learn and learn.\"\n\n\"I remember hearing one parent saying,\" says Jamie, \"that the kids needed to take the math test.\" That's when she started to learn. \"I'd like to take the math test for sure.\"\n\nAs a result, after an hour, her first math test was over. And when she went home, she was on her way to completing a math question. \"I didn't feel like I was even a real math teacher. I felt like I was going to fail,\" she says.\n\nFor some families, it took the kids three full years to learn the math test. For James, it took two more years for their daughter to come to work.\n\n\"We were just so excited to see them learn the math,\" James says. \"It was so much fun, and you could hear her laughing out loud. It was so much fun to watch them do the math. I'm a parent. I love to see my kids doing the math test so much.\"\n\nAt first, James and his family didn't want to have to do the math, but then he started to see how they felt like they could be smarter.

For the first time on record, an RCMP investigation found women found themselves with sexual assault before they turned 18.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe number of sexual assaults in 2013 climbed to 18 from 563 for the first time since 2007, and 13 more in 2014 than in 2000. In 2013, only four sexual assaults occurred while 18- and 19-year-olds were in the workplace or at work, while for the first time in 30 years, the number of sexual assaults among those aged 18-to-29 was nearly double its 2000 high.\n\n\"It seems a little early to call upon the public to step up and make these sorts of changes, but there is a lot of good news out there. Some victims still report being harassed on the job,\" said Sgt. Brian Williams, deputy director of the RCMP's Sexual Crimes Unit.\n\nMr. Williams said he still believes there may be many reasons why some women avoid the sexual assault scene when they come forward, but they don't want to have that happen.\n\n\"The problem is it takes a long time to get a woman in there and we're not always sure if you can get past it at first or just have a slow reaction period to get to the scene,\" he said. \"If you're going to be on that train to get to the scene and there's some initial hesitation that is, then it's just going to be waiting for you to come out there to the front.\"\n\nThe Mounties recommend that all women avoid sexual harassment and assault investigations.

Ms. Brown said she was not and was not going to be taking any other drugs.\n\nAfter the incident, Ms. Brown and a colleague returned home from a bar and stopped to take a shower, she said. Then he asked her not to be in for any more drinks in the parking lot.\n\n\"I said, 'He's leaving, I'll stop you,' \" Ms. Brown said.

It is one of the most important items on a Forbes list as it is the only item I am missing; I wanted to get my own list of most essential items.\n\nMy goal is not to rank every great item but to show you something that might be valuable!\n\nI've tried using a list and I try not to list the exact value but it gets me some things going so I thought I would share some of the items on my list. Below is some of the item list from the list:\n\nIn a lot of years, I have always had an interest in technology and technology can be something that may be useful to the economy or maybe something I want to find out from my research about. With the new financial system being created through a combination of a regulatory mechanism and a regulatory system that is based on the US regulatory system, I see new technologies, like smart products, that could be the next big thing. But until now, I have been a huge fan of the financial system.\n\nA lot of people think of a financial system and it is really simple in principle. And there are a lot of people who think about the economic system as well. So there is no need to talk about it and not to mention the fact that it could be in many ways like a banking system that does exactly the same thing to your average person. There are things like the Internet of Things, things like the smart phone with Bluetooth, something like that. All the above things could be used by a bank just like a financial system does to your personal financial data. We all think of it as a very simple concept, no need to have a list of the most important ones on the list.\n\nBut there is no need to discuss it with anyone. You need to have some kind of basic understanding of how it works but when we talk about something as complex as banking there is no need to talk about it. And as far as I could tell, banking is one of the best things that can be done in this world and there never was a more beautiful world, so I really hope that I will share some of the most important things about banking. What I think you need to know before you start getting involved in business is there is no need to mention it with your manager, your financial adviser, your finance director or your manager at all. No need to worry about all the things but you might also talk to some of my bankers that are a big part of their life.\n\nWhat is one of the most important things on your list?\n\nDo you have some personal personal information on your computer while it was running when you were using it?\n\nAre you using it for any reason and I don't know if you have any personal personal information. But I believe it is something that you can use for personal gain or to give your company some ideas. I think this is really important with banking as you can't always take a look at what is important about a system and if they are not there you should have no problem.\n\nSome personal information that is going to be helpful to you include:\n\nAny other credit history/current financial institution you know of to give you some tips if you are one of those that is going to have an account\n\nAny other financial info or notes about your current accounts and how you can find more or make an appointment with them or any other financial information you will be able to share with them\n\nWhich of the following three items do you use for personal information as opposed to personal contact information and which of your personal information do you need to keep?\n\nDo you have an account number that you would like shared with me or how could I contact a person who holds the right kind of credit score? How can I give the information to the credit score company before I can make an appointment? How can I give you a credit score card if you have one that is a U.S. Federal debt?\n\nI would like to have an individual or a small group of credit scores to use for personal information. If you have any questions or comments about the list, I can help you out. My contact information is in Google Docs or a personal profile.\n\nI believe this is something you should never have to give to someone who is in the public eye like me and you may want to have someone who is an attorney or a psychiatrist contact me if there is something that is important with your situation.\n\nWhat is your current financial situation or why are you with so many people, especially on a business level, making life difficult for you?\n\nI think most people are looking for a family, if they feel like they need that, or any financial situation, I would highly appreciate to be able to talk directly to that to get more of information about it.\n\nA", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

For instance, the website for an online music blog called LiveScience has over 300,000 members (which includes a community of fans who can help each other decide for themselves how a piece of music should be heard).\n\nWhen it comes to content, one can read that more than half of the blogs created by fans on both their social media accounts and their Instagram pages share some of the same themes or themes from their experiences.\n\nThe most common theme is of the old-timey genre known as \"music for the masses,\" which refers to the music and artists it influenced and created.\n\nWhat is different is that this is where people can also share their own musical ideas and experiences. This is especially true for live-action albums or records, such as \"The Beach Boys,\" \"Album of the Year,\" \"Best New Music\" and \"The Beatles,\" of which there are over 50,000 posts each month.\n\nThe content of the songs on these pages or in their audio archives is also created in this way. It's not just about the songs. It's about sharing their experiences or thoughts on a song. It's also about helping one another, or sharing the news that has been published on a particular online website. Whether or not it's a positive or negative message may vary a little, but we don't know.\n\nSocial media is also a key to what the masses can do for creativity. \"A new generation of music fans is starting to feel a sense of belonging at home with their favorite artists. The artists' opinions and personalities have become a natural part of them,\" says Michael F. Davis, professor of social media at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nMany users of the sites found it easier to share their musical ideas with others or take a look at music, but the main difference that can change the way fans work is the amount and the content.\n\nOne of the best uses of the Internet is as a platform for people to share their memories and insights, because now many people know which songs to listen to in the future and which to pick up in the present.\n\n\"When people see a new song or song about musicians, they can have these kind of emotional and artistic thoughts in their head,\" says Davis. \"All those memories will be preserved there so it will help all musicians to experience different music from different eras of music and to share their thoughts and experiences with each other and their fans as they try to understand and appreciate this song.\"\n\nSo how is music affected in the future in relation to these new social media platforms? And can we see these ideas in a positive or negative way as time goes on?\n\n\"This is where music fans who are already familiar with these social media platforms start realizing how important it is to not just share their ideas of what an artist or an artist is, but to give them a voice, their creative energy and an input into making an impact,\" says Davis.\n\n\"For musicians who have no such background, it gives them the courage to open it up to anyone they are interested.\"\n\n\"I think music is the key to all this. By having this connection you can get a sense of what an artist's voice or the type of music or a piece of music really is,\" says F. D'Angelo. \"As we learn more, we can learn more about just how a group of people work together to create something that helps. Through this, we also get to see a lot of amazing examples of how music can be used as platform for more creative work and for the creative power of music. And of course, our community of music fans, including musicians, live musicians and fans of music as they watch it unfold,\" F. D'Angelo concludes.\n\nCheck out the other music-focused blogs and social media sites below.\n\nPhoto: Flickr/Daniel-Leighton", "length": 1003, "ended": true}

In the U.S., the unemployment rate has risen by 6.4 million people from the 2011 to 2015\u2014enough to make a $6.8 billion salary. The percentage of U.S. working age adults without a job has declined nearly 3 million since 2009, the report said.\n\n\"It will take an even bigger wave of immigration to prevent the unemployment rate from declining,\" the report warns. That won't happen soon, though. \"The U.S. would need about 1.3 million new immigrants next year to stabilize the economy,\" the report says. \"While the number of people without jobs could decline from at least 500 million a year to perhaps 100 million in 2035, that increase in labor force participation will probably offset much of the decline. While the U.S. would suffer from a similar level of national unemployment to those in China and other developing nations, it still would need about 700 million to stabilize the economy. Moreover, if China were to adopt a similar national labor force structure following the 2016 election, the growth in U.S. net exports would be so rapid that it would cost about $1.5 trillion.\"", "length": 292, "ended": true}

First, what does \"literal\" mean? How do schools teach these subjects, particularly literacy and language skills? Does it apply to everyone, from students to teachers to the teachers? Is it useful for everyone if we are looking at the classroom as an \"outstanding field of study\"? A simple look at these questions and what you learn can lead you to some very fundamental changes in your own learning and thinking as a child.\n\n\nIn this new edition of The Great Educator's Guide to Literacy and Language, Gormley offers an unprecedented insight into the subject and explains the basic, overarching structure of the \"literally\" vocabulary of our time, as well as how it is used by so many people in our communities.\n\n\nGormley's work has been cited as a \"must read\" for parents and school teachers, both outside of the classroom as well as by students and parents. By using the words of authors who teach literacy and language as one way of getting their children reading as well as for teachers, these editors will show you how to give your children a way to say and learn whatever their teacher tells them to say. It is a fascinating way to give kids, both children and adults, an opportunity to see and learn. This way of presenting a range of examples is an important way to help kids learn and get on with their lives. Preview this book \u00bb", "length": 354, "ended": true}

It marked the first time for that type of data of interest to be posted on a global online portal.\n\nAccording to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which monitors a number of such causes of death, nearly seven out of 10 people die in their 20s \u2013 and the rate of suicide is nearly twice higher than the rate of other such causes (more than 15 per cent vs 20 per cent). The health data suggests that about 5,000 people in the US and 15,700 in the EU are now dying of heart attacks every day, mostly from suicide. In all there are around 3,000 more heart attacks than were recorded last year in the US but that figure is likely to be reduced under the current administration and government.\n\nThe data also show that people aged 25-29 who took their own lives have experienced a 20 per cent rise in the number of people using the internet. A third of those who had not used their device since the start of their lives have experienced a decrease.\n\nThe rise in suicides was greatest among young Australians who may be already aware of the use of the internet, which increased by 40 per cent after the start of 2015 alone.\n\nDespite the rising numbers of people using the internet with the most use of smartphones they have yet to die by suicide, the numbers are still climbing. Of those who were recently diagnosed with dementia they had a rate three times higher than the rest of the sample, while among those aged 40-59 it was more than double the rate of people aged 40-59.\n\n\"The latest data on suicide is a major change from the previous year, and we are still seeing a great deal from rising numbers of people who were getting the diagnosis and treatment they need. This data highlights a significant change as well as the impact that people's personal connections like the ability to connect with others in a way that's both public and social, to help the public cope with their struggles, whether that be with illness, substance abuse or mental illness,\" said Susan Goulburn, the Director of Public Health at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.\n\n\"I want to reassure the public that we will take action in the coming months to get that change done, and that it is a very easy and quick fix.\"\n\nGoulburn said her organisation is committed to keeping people safer and helped create a new roundabout tool in 2015 which enabled users to make comments about the current situation.

{"id": 250038, "text": "The Department of Justice, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Southern Poverty Law Center have all identified the \"radical mosques\" as having radical Islamic teachings, and have taken issue with the fact that they have refused to report the name of any mosques or mosques where members of the religious group appear to \"engage in radicalization or radical behavior.\" The Center also says that their \"research found that such members are being actively supported and encouraged to carry out jihadism by both religious organizations and individuals, but not by non-religious leaders.\"\n\nIn April, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani was interviewed by a group called The Right Stuff, whose website was also described by New York Times' James O'Keefe as a \"public relations hit job.\" In July, a federal judge in California ruled that the Southern Poverty Law Center does not need that designation in order to report on its political work. The groups include a mosque called Amira's Islamic Center in New Haven, Connecticut; a synagogue in Brooklyn that is part of the Jewish Center in Greenwich Village; and a mosque that hosts a dinner club with former members of the Islamic Society of Greater New York in the U.S.\n\nAs you can see by the picture you can see the SPLC has a problem. At the bottom they list a number of imams and sharia-oriented Muslim organizations that are part of a loose network with which they often work but are not always in full compliance. The SPLC has even been seen at the center when there are many other Islamic centers that are part of its network and this is not always. For example the Southern Poverty Law Center published a website with many \"Islamophobes\" who are \"radicalizing\" and criticizing the country and Muslims for being \"bad Muslims.\"\n\nIn January, the Southern Poverty Law Center said they should not have identified Amira's Islamic Center because it was a radical mosque. However, the SPLC now states that, as of Aug. 19, they also \"not only did not identify Amira's Islamic Center.\" In other words that they did not need to identify Amira's mosque because the SPLC already has the name of this mosque and they have a right to do so.\n\nAs the Los Angeles Times noted, they have since published statements to the LA Times saying that AMR's mosque is not a mosque, they have never claimed they are a mosque, that they are a group of radicals, and that they have made a \"complete and utter misrepresentation\" of the Islamization of America. The Southern Poverty Law Center is no longer working with them on their efforts on their website.\n\nThe SPLC, as the New York Times indicates, does not have one of their Muslim Brotherhood or Islamic Council spokesmen, but instead an affiliated American Coalition of Concerned Scientists, as the Times states. The Center of Public Integrity, however, says that the center \"exceeds its responsibilities as a political advocacy organization to comply with court regulations and laws and protect citizens from being misled by these political groups and individuals.\"\n\nThe Center's director of communications, Sarah Davis, says that she has never met or spoken with this center.\n\n\"It's completely unbelievable how people who are not politically connected are going to think that a Muslim who uses the term 'radical Muslim' is what they call a Muslim. As far as the Islamic organization concerned, they're simply not working with them. They're not working with anyone else. They don't know who they are. They're working with the State Department,\" Davis says. \"They don't even know if you're a member.\"\n\nThe center does receive an \"A.I.,\" it has only \"I.\" Davis describes the name as meaning that it is \"no longer working with\" these folks and that it is \"not affiliated with a specific Muslim organization.\"\n\nIt is not clear from the New York Times report whether Amira's Muslim Center is an Islamic center, or whether the Center's leadership is just pretending that it is not affiliated with any particular group of radical Muslims. But the New York Times report notes that Amira's Islamic Center is funded by American taxpayers, so as the New York Times said, the Center has no government-based connections with the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR or CAIR) in a manner that indicates its not affiliated with them.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Amira's leader, Mohammed Abu Fadl al Makal, said that it was his group that inspired him to become a jihadist, and that it is \"always looking for new ideas.\"\n\nIn an interview with the LA Times, Makal said she is open to \"becoming more diverse and new to the West.\"\n\nA senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, James B.

{"id": 250039, "text": "The first major effort toward a comprehensive health bill was recently launched by Republican lawmakers in the midst of a national debate over Medicaid expansion. In a new report released today by the National Partnership on Health Policy, researchers from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation found that 1 in 3 Americans has high blood pressure, a high risk of diabetes, and high cholesterol. And that may be a symptom of high levels of chronic disease.\n\nThe report also notes that health officials estimate that between 25 and 55 percent of Americans who live with a heart condition can have the heart bypass cut.\n\nThese findings may give physicians a better idea of the health risks associated with using the program, although the data is only a starting point for a broader public debate.\n\nThe analysis also notes that the most common cause of heart disease is hypertension, which is linked to heart attack. The CDC estimated that 30 percent of Americans living with cardiovascular condition have a history of hypertension. And it cited evidence that the use of heart bypass services to prevent heart attacks can reduce or prevent some of the underlying causes of the disease.\n\n\"If we want to protect individuals and the public who live with hypertension, that means not only getting a health professional to advise on ways to reduce blood pressure, but also not taking away one person's ability to afford these procedures for a lifetime,\" said Dr. Michael E. McGovern, MD, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the McGovern School of Medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and director of the Kaiser Center for Health Policy.\n\nTo make their findings public, the researchers looked at three primary factors that could influence the likelihood that a patient will receive a heart bypass operation: the time the patient has left in the hospital, how long it took the man, and whether the family would agree to a lower risk of heart attack.\n\n\"That's all part of the equation. The other is it's a matter of the patient's health,\" said Dr. Richard C. O'Keefe, MD, professor of medicine at Dartmouth College who is in charge of the study. \"We've been looking at other ways to lower diabetes risk.\"\n\nIn other words, the study suggests that getting coronary bypass should not lead to high blood pressure in any way. If a person who has a lower blood pressure is more likely to have a higher risk of diabetes, the best thing to do would be to reduce the blood pressure significantly.\n\nDr. O'Keefe told Healthline that the researchers also did not know whether a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes would be associated with heart bypass. There was no mention that the type of heart bypass surgery was considered onerous in the study.\n\n\"We don't do coronary bypass surgery at all,\" said Dr. Nils Holmberg, MD, director of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's Circulatory Injury Research Center and a leader in efforts to promote lower blood pressure surgery.\n\nBut there is a possible benefit from this approach based on what the researchers found. Heart bypass surgery is relatively cheap, taking less than a couple of dollars a month.\n\n\"By lowering risk of blood pressure, people would get better health outcomes,\" Dr. O'Keefe said. \"The good news is that the benefits that we've observed are not going to translate into more costs or new ways to reduce risk. So, the bottom line, the key difference is that the cost is just one element.\"\n\nThis was a major focus of the Center for Prevention of Obesity and Obesity Prevention at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, according to The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe heart bypass research was funded by the Kaiser Permanente Grant Division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n###", "length": 762, "ended": true}

Some Republicans say the proposals could be too radical to pass unless they eliminate tax breaks for some big corporations. But a Romney-backed proposal to raise the corporate tax rate from 39 percent to 50 percent appears to have some success in Congress.\n\n\"This is a big break for the middle class,\" Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom told reporters Saturday at the debate in Las Vegas. \"It would be incredibly important to repeal and replace all of President Barack Obama's executive actions. We've got a lot of work ahead of us. But I wouldn't be surprised if he does that.\"\n\nThe Senate's nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said Romney said the plan offered modest tax reform, but offered several proposals with a \"big difference\" from what he campaigned for in 2012.\n\nThat has not translated into the broad agreement in the House. House Speaker John Boehner's leadership plan has not said whether the House would extend tax breaks to other big businesses and to private-sector businesses.\n\nThe Republican proposal \u2014 which had previously been opposed by many senators and Republican governors who said the proposal would hurt small business \u2014 would leave the country in a bind if both chambers pass a joint proposal.\n\nBoehner said a final tax plan is under discussion, with the White House trying to get a final vote before November. \"The House would move ahead with this next round so we might be able to start negotiations this year on a bipartisan plan,\" he said. The House has until December to act.\n\nIn the House, Democratic leaders have tried to persuade lawmakers to approve the tax plan through amendments, sometimes with little success because of the partisan divisions in Washington.\n\nThat was partly a symptom of the Democratic weakness. Most Republicans oppose the plan \u2014 a strong endorsement in some Republican areas that even some Democrats agree with \u2014 because many of them believe that raising the corporate taxes would make our economy grow at a faster rate than the economy can pick up \u2014 a problem that could also threaten the prospects of a more stable economy.\n\nBut Ryan argued last week that the GOP measure could actually make a significant difference, and in a speech in Iowa last weekend, he called the measure a \"big breakthrough.\"\n\nRepublicans have struggled to get Republicans to support a separate approach to the plan. Some Republicans who support the plan said it would cut government spending and increase taxes on the middle class, in large part because the GOP plan would lower taxes on millionaires and billionaires. That policy proposal would still need to be approved by the House and Senate before reaching the presidential level.\n\nSome conservatives worry that the plans could make the situation even more complicated. They say they will oppose the plan even if they can't find a way past the final stage of a vote. But they also worry this will help Republicans gain ground as the race moves closer.\n\nGOP leaders have pushed back against the idea that the tax plan would provide much help to the middle class \u2014 a position that has led some conservative lawmakers to dismiss the tax plan as a partisan bargain. Republicans say the plan simply raises the corporate tax rate on incomes over $250 million.", "length": 713, "ended": true}

The story itself is notable for an attempt to draw attention to the problem, not to address it.\n\nEven with the arrest of Daniel Erickson for allegedly defacing the city's Confederate statue, the story is a farce; the public has failed to take to the streets to denounce the actions of city leaders and officials, or to see these leaders involved in the issue. If the police are to continue their investigation after it is revealed that the former police chief had \"repeatedly\" violated local law, that's a big enough violation.\n\nThe Times story is part of a long line of stories on the \"crime of celebrity journalism,\" and it raises more questions. Does celebrity, like other prominent, well-known celebrities, know their own story and are they aware of it? Is the media willing to try to tell the truth? Will the media even let the public see that the problem has not been solved, that the public is demanding justice to that the public must confront the issue?\n\nAnd if the media does expose this scandal, is there a public pressure campaign to expose the problem?\n\nThe story is another example of how reporters often treat their subject as if he or she is a celebrity. But does it also reflect a general tendency to treat celebrities as if they are celebrities, or are they some sort of celebrity?\n\nThere are, then, important issues to take into account. First, it should be noted that the police were first contacted by a citizen organization, and this investigation should be taken into account.\n\nSecond, the Times story is one more example of public attitudes toward the public being ignored.\n\nFinally, any public service announcement about celebrity journalism needs to be addressed as though it are about celebrity celebrity journalism.

{"id": 250044, "text": "Mental health is an issue that affects all Americans. The CDC notes that mental health is a \"critical public health issue because, as of 2012, a total of 6.9 million adults were seriously affected by depression; and that 1.2 million Americans with mental disorders received services from mental health care providers and that 2.6 million Americans had been hospitalized or incarcerated for mental health issues.5 However, in order to provide a comprehensive information on how to treat mental health issues, the CDC is trying to build consensus from the profession on the relationship between mental health and the overall prevalence of mental health disorders and disability.\"6\n\nPsychiatric Illness\n\nIt is commonly thought that mental illness comes from the fact that physical illness, a severe form of addiction, can cause a person to develop an increased risk of disease, such as schizophrenia. Although this is not a proven fact, however, it is common knowledge that people who feel sick or weak and, even when they recover, are at greater risk for having a mental illness that causes the person to experience some of the underlying symptoms of a mental illness.\n\nOne of the most common reasons that young people have mental health problems is that they have been under-diagnosed or over-diagnosed in a very short span of time. In a study of 1,600 people enrolled in the Mental Health and Aging Study, an independent, non-institutionalized group of 1,918 older adults, approximately 1.5 million adults (over age 30) in the United States, were randomly assigned to receive either a long-term mental health counseling program or a short-term mental health education center (MHCAC).\n\nThe MHCAC program was created to provide education and support to younger people, in order to better understand, assess, and prevent mental illness. However, this program has resulted in some health professionals and others questioning its purpose. To address their concerns, CDC's MHCAC program found that the focus on physical illness, rather than mental health, led to fewer adolescents being diagnosed with a mental illness.\n\nAccording to the US Conference of State Legislatures, over 4 million new diagnoses of mental disorders occur in the US every year.\n\nThe prevalence of mental illnesses among youth in the United States has increased steadily since 2000. Although many mental health care providers and mental health programs remain underfunded, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) continues to monitor, assess, and provide mental health services for youth.7 The National Comorbidity Survey, sponsored by NCHS, provides a comprehensive survey of mental health and substance abuse professionals in the United States by age and gender to inform them about mental health.\n\nThe CDC's MHCAC program emphasizes the importance of prevention to prevent mental illnesses. A study of 1,600 participants in the United States Mental Health Examination of Individuals and Families at a Time Study provides evidence that the prevention of mental disease is strongly tied to social support by children and adults with disabilities.8\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that in the 2000 U.S. population, approximately 2 million individuals with mental disorders were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder or other psychiatric disorder, representing an increase of 7.4% from 2000.9 In 2002 alone, over 7.2 million individuals with mental disorders were diagnosed with mental illnesses.10\n\nIn addition, approximately 6.1 million people were diagnosed with psychiatric illness in 2002, but over 5.7 million were treated in the U.S. As of December 2002, approximately 2.6 million youth with mental health problems were in health care.11 Over 6.6 million of those youth are classified as having an adverse or serious diagnosis.11\n\nThe CDC estimates that approximately 13 million young people would develop serious and long-term mental health problems in the United States if the U.S. were to become a major country.12\n\nConclusion\n\nA number of factors may contribute to the overall prevalence of mental health disorders in the young population.\n\nMental health professionals have become more involved in the public health community by becoming involved in a public conversation about mental health issues and their underlying causes.\n\nAs a result, more young people are becoming aware of this issue and are able to help provide additional care to help with their mental health issues.\n\nThe public engagement of the public health community in education, support, and advocacy for mental health problems is a key part of this national effort.\n\nThe United States, a world leader in mental health, emphasizes that mental health, particularly bipolar disorder and anxiety, is an under-diagnosed disorder with an underlying underlying medical condition that is life-threatening for most adults.12\n\nMental health is also an under-reported health problem, but these are common medical conditions and should be treated with care and care because of its long term and health consequences.13\n\nAs part of its ongoing efforts to improve mental health in America, health care providers and mental health organizations also work for improved mental health among persons with mental illness", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

Or do both?\n\nOn the surface it appears as if the FBI didn't even know, as we recently saw in its report, that Hillary Clinton had sent out emails about her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. The FBI also noted in the report that Clinton's server is locked inside. So if it took the FBI almost two years to find out who would be doing that, there is absolutely nothing that they can do. Here's a quick primer on what this means:\n\nThe FBI believes that the Clinton server is private. Its sole purpose is to help the FBI with investigations into the alleged misuse of a private server.\n\nThe government, which also may have been involved in the setup of the hacked email systems at the Russian embassy in the US, has been unable to stop some of the messages from spreading and has been unable to bring in a full-scale investigation.\n\nThe FBI may have discovered that some emails the firm sent to the agency in 2012 about the server of Clinton's former State Department communications director, John Podesta were in violation of federal laws and may have been sent through a third party server.\n\nThe FBI had no choice but to shut down the Clinton campaign. At least that's the theory, according to NBC News.\n\n\"The FBI has been forced to conclude that the emails and those messages sent to the Clinton campaign were in violation of federal law,\" the FBI said in a statement.\n\nFBI spokesman David Boaz, who briefed his employees on the matter on Monday, says that the department isn't allowed to disclose when or if it was able to find out about the emails during their initial review.\n\n\nIn his remarks to CNN Tuesday, Boaz added, \"I'm not going to give you the specifics. The FBI needs to have all its information under wraps.\"\n\nThe FBI has not commented on the FBI's latest report about the server.\n\nIf that information, we have to guess, was sent from her private server.\n\nThe FBI has released all of its records for two months now.

{"id": 250049, "text": "\nSydney has been caught up in a series of scandals regarding the handling of its former premier, Malcolm Turnbull. The saga began when the former leader, then Liberal leader Howard Whittingdale, was in the midst of a major leadership debate about the party's role in the public sector when he was tipped off by an anonymous report about a government funding project. While it was revealed that the money was for research into the environment, it was later put in the hands of other private investors.\n\nSince that time, the media attention has focussed on Turnbull but is the public eye's focus elsewhere. It has been alleged that he has been mismanagement and there is widespread suspicion among some insiders that he could be a candidate for prime minister.\n\nIt has also been alleged Turnbull was pressured by his colleagues at the ABC to put forward a plan to replace him, something he refused. Some experts have raised concerns in the media that the public's attention seems focused on what was wrong with the government and Turnbull, rather than on the issues.\n\nThe case has raised questions about whether Turnbull could have avoided the scandal if he had been allowed to return to power, to take more time under a leadership challenge, or even just to run on a smaller staff, with more of an emphasis on his own interests and political ambitions.\n\nThe case has also raised questions about whether or not Turnbull could become a serious contender for Prime Minister. In the eyes of some he is just another young leader whose work ethic is being questioned. If, by any chance, Turnbull was to take his time and focus on business rather than politics, that would be a problem. That would mean he did not have to be ready to run for office.\n\nSome analysts say Turnbull is at the highest level of power, perhaps as little as nine months away. For the next eight months there remain doubts about him. When he leaves office, his new chief of staff is expected to be in charge of public sector work.\n\nAnother issue appears to be around the media reaction to the revelations, particularly over the Fairfax Herald, the most high-profile publication by a former government minister. Many say the coverage has become too sensational, or that it has become so focused on Turnbull's own political future. While many of the reports were inaccurate, they also highlighted problems in the handling of the media's coverage.\n\nThe Herald has also recently been targeted by government journalists following an incident that occurred in which an editor at the paper attempted to smear journalist Mark Eakin for the Times. Eakin had been working at one of the paper's main newspapers, but was sacked in November with his position because he refused to provide a picture of his character.\n\nThe situation has emerged after the Herald contacted Mr Turnbull, asking about questions about why Eakin had not said he would not comment if confronted with an article about his role as chairman of the federal party's political party, which Mr Turnbull has denied. Mr Abbott said he was under no obligation to clarify or clarify the situation.\n\nBut some media outlets have reported reports that the newspaper's editor, Simon Kelleher, was at the Herald while he was tipped off about the allegations. Mr Kelleher later told The Sun that the accusations had been \"nothing more than what happened at the Herald\", while his bosses were \"disappointed\".\n\nMr Turnbull, who will leave office on January 50, has faced calls to quit a key Cabinet position when he takes over until after he comes to power at midnight on February 15. Some senior aides have criticised the decision, writing in the Herald: \"Malcolm Turnbull had a serious and hard choice - he should quit immediately or the media will treat him poorly.\"\n\nOthers have noted that he has the backing of Labor's chief of staff, Mark Di Natale, and would not be allowed to return to the prime minister's office at all. Both have said they felt that leaving the position was the right thing to do.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Australian Federal Police (AfAP), the independent agency accused of running the leak case which revealed that Abbott had been working for the newspaper and then having sex with a reporter, said it was \"sending a message of criticism and not support for Mr Turnbull\". An official with the bureau declined to comment.\n\nIf he does leave the government on January 50, Mr Turnbull will find himself on a collision course with the public once again. An Abbott government would not rule out pursuing litigation before the general election.\n\nTopics: government-and-politics, government-and-politics, government-and-politics, federal-elections, australia\n\nFirst posted", "length": 947, "ended": true}

He has refused to issue a document in which he describes himself with respect to the country, and Mr. Trump has been careful not to label anyone by their own words.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet in recent days, Mr. Trump has made a series of calls to President Obama and to both of them about his deportation policy and the fate of nearly 400,000 people illegally staying in the country.\n\nMr. Trump said that he would seek to stop the program without the Justice Department, but Mr. Obama and President Bush both had an understanding that the process could quickly spiral out of control.\n\nMr. Trump also said that he would release everyone who had been sentenced to more than 60 years in prison, although he did not specify that date.\n\nMr. Trump also promised to deport all illegal immigrants who have been convicted in absentia during his presidency, and his announcement that he would \"end mass deportations\" would cause a flood of immigrants into the country. His announcement that he wanted to keep deportation rates at 50 percent for illegal immigrants was met with widespread protests in the United States.\n\nThe president's first budget, released in February, said the cost of the program would be at a staggering $2 trillion, with $2.3 trillion going toward the programs that cost the federal government far more than the federal government.\n\nHe said he needed to use that money to expand the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which helps protect young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States legally as children.\n\n''I'm trying to make sure that those who have been here in the United States for about a quarter-century should not be able to get here without a visa,'' Mr. Trump said, according to reporters outside his Mar-a-Lago Club.\n\n\"We want to create jobs. We want to provide safe, secure jobs and protection for our kids,'' he said, pointing to the jobs created in construction.\n\nThe program is meant to help provide a legal boost to people who have committed serious crimes, like a convicted terrorist, who can become a U.S. citizen and then receive legal status for up to seven years, which, Mr. Trump said, could happen in ten years.\n\nIn a speech to small business leaders this week at the White House, Mr. Trump said that an amnesty for many people would be good for business \u2014 but not necessarily good for the country.\n\n''We have always said that the country must always be free, not in a vacuum, or with one hand tied behind our back,'' Mr. Trump said. ''But it has to be that this country has many very good people in this country . . . We should not be giving amnesty to those who work hard and play by the rules. I want for them to not turn back and find a new life.''\n\nWhen asked if he would release all the people he wants to release, Mr. Trump said yes to two questions: First, does he want to give amnesty to those who went to jail under his predecessor but later have to seek a change of fate? Second, is he willing to do so without public comment?", "length": 979, "ended": true}

The report said there are two major issues in the oil sector that may cause additional greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decade. The first of these is the impact of high oil prices on the world's production of petroleum fuels. It's already causing much of that world's carbon emissions.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration said the region is responsible for 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe study also says the Arctic is likely to have more carbon emissions from methane and lignite as well as methane and nitrous oxide than all other regions and has the potential to contain a quarter \u2013 or about 1 percent \u2013 of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n\"For those regions that are less economically dependent on the oil industry in the future, a significant increase in oil, gas, and coal emissions could be expected to contribute as much as 9 percent to global greenhouse gas emission,\" the report says. \"However, this estimate cannot possibly account for increases in carbon emissions due to natural or man-made greenhouse gases. Therefore, any increases in coal or methane emission due to natural or man-made greenhouse gases would only result in 1 percent to 2 percent of warming over the next century.\"\n\nThe first major problem in climate change is that the world's oceans and ocean waters are currently warming at their current rates. However, if there's an increase or decrease in ocean gas and dissolved solids in the oceans, global warming will cause it to accelerate. That should happen by 2100, said the IPCC in July.\n\nThe report says the Arctic is already a highly volatile mix for both ocean gas and dissolved solids, but they may continue to grow over time, since they tend to expand around the Arctic Ocean after they're removed from the atmosphere, rather than as the gases are removed from their atmosphere.\n\nThe Arctic is also expected to develop some of its least resilient climate change mechanisms. The country is likely to be a key region in its climate policy and its carbon emissions continue to rise.\n\nThe report concluded:\n\n\"Given the potential for warming the world should not be characterized as an unprecedented event. However, changes in the timing and intensity of these long-term trends should have a powerful impact on how the global economy and climate change policy are likely to play out. As with the other major factors in climate change, such changes are likely to be accompanied by significant changes in land-use patterns for natural resources. These changes, combined with the possible effects of warming the ocean, are expected to produce significant greenhouse gases.\"\n\nClick here to read the full report, which has nearly 945 pages of analysis by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2nIq4cK", "length": 636, "ended": true}

{"id": 250057, "text": ". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nThe third and final one is in \"Ecclesiastes\", a collection of the last ten centuries. (He calls it the \"Great Work of God. For the seventh century it had no power to restrain it, and the sixth century he had to destroy it with fire.\" ) The work of the Bible had many enemies over its origin in pagan times \u2014 many of them, for example, with the Greeks, Christians, and pagans. But one of the most powerful enemies of the \"Great Work of God\" was the Pharisees.\n\nTheir \"new\" belief was the \"one handedness\" of Scripture which God had \"sealed\" to a man. By these the Jewish church was called to defend themselves against the \"Christian\" world, and those in authority sought to \"convey\" the Gospel on a human level. In so doing they were doing so in a way contrary to their original belief. In fact there were a number of sects in the early church, both in the 1st and 2nd centuries (a period which may not seem long to lay claim to Jesus since he was not an infant but a young virgin). So much for the Pharisees, even since it is said that they were both the Pharisees and the first \"Christians,\" this does not prove that all the teachings in the book of Moses were true. Yet here they did have a very formidable rival.\n\nThe Pharisees have been so successful in undermining Christianity of late, that they became known as the \"new Pharisees.\" They believe that the Bible, and many other scripture texts, are the New Testament of God, and that these passages are from all ages. But they can speak only of those which, and even those passages which are in all ages.\n\nThe Pharisees believed in three doctrines:\n\n1. The Word of God was one revelation from God to us as given to the Word of God in the Bible. The Word of God is a revelation from God, which, according to certain works of scripture and history, will be found in all time, form, form, form. This revelation is that the Father gave the Son, and through the Son came into being into the world. This revelation to us is the Word of God, or, to be more precise, the Word of God's nature .\n\nWe do believe, however, in the possibility that if we had seen the twofold nature of God, and if we had experienced through the Word of God that which was in the Scriptures, we would have realized and understood the Word of God. But what is our purpose of seeing this revealed Word as being, if not in itself, in fact, true? We have already said what they called the \"New Prophets,\" and what we call the \"New Apostles,\" and these have been, as the Jewish writers say, those Jews who understood their original mission.\n\nTo some (as the Pharisees say, some as the Christian writers say) the New Prophets have nothing to do with the whole picture that God revealed to us in the Old Testament. But we have some of them that think of this as they did, and do believe with some as they did. For I know that the Apostles had many, but none had a very great number; and it may be said that they were quite as well out of the question as a lot of the New Church Fathers.\n\n2. This was the Word of God to all of us who were living in the Old and New ages. But that is nothing more than the idea of all things that were in our time, so far as they can be understood, though it may seem to us that they came from outside the Old World, or that their name is not a name, but they came from outside of that World in order to serve that God in the world through the Word.\n\nThe Word of God is an original, the Word of God, as found in everything that we believe. In the Old Testament all the Scriptures contain such Scriptures as God wrote to Abraham, but the Old Testament records only the words of the prophets as they used to read the scriptures, and so we do not know which books were written in which place. We know that these same prophets came from outside of the Bible, but there are three things that they called into question when they spoke of God, the First and the Last.\n\nIn all things the first thing the Word said (the same as all the other things the New Testament mentions):\n\n\"God's Word, the Word of the Father, the Last Word was written on the scroll of the prophet, the first revelation from God to us.

It also said the move also reflects strong support in European countries such as Belgium and France for tax reforms that are in support of people's sovereignty and individual rights.\n\nMeanwhile, a further crackdown has come on banks, which were forced to disclose their customer data during their trading in euros due to a tax bill by the European Central Bank.\n\nThere has also been a further investigation on the companies by a police inquiry which said the data was relevant in investigating how Barclays and Visa handled European money transfers between their offices in London and Barcelona on 24 May.", "length": 296, "ended": true}

{"id": 250062, "text": "Lara Cushing of Tewksbury, Massachusetts has long been known as a progressive activist and political organizer who, along with her young daughter, now serves a mandate with the Green Party. While that has earned her a fair share of attention from the media and politicians, she's been on a road trip through many local organizations through the past few years. And now she's bringing the story of her experience to a local activist organization, The American Society of Poultry and Seafood Workers (ASPW).\n\nAfter nearly four decades of living on farms in Illinois and Texas, Kaitlin Pugh joined the ASPW in 1992 in a volunteer role as a volunteer. \"It was my dream to start a farm. It was my passion,\" she says with a bit of sarcasm, in reference to the \"diversity movement\" she helped launch decades ago. Then, last week, \"she was running again, and it just came out that we were back in Illinois doing volunteer work,\" Kaitlin says. \"And we had already been elected to one board with an increased number of candidates, and we were trying to get the other committees to go in. Then we did and all the politicians in that board were out of town. And then it really started to snowball out of control. This was then my own personal, personal mission. My mission to show the voters of those offices and the public that there was nothing wrong with us doing what we did and to say that there were ways we could do to keep moving forward. And at the time, we hadn't realized we had to push it through. And I think that's one of the reasons that so many people, especially in this area, who have been involved with farm workers for as long as I have have have been afraid to speak up \u2013 as much as I can \u2013 and to try to convince the public that they still have to be held accountable. And so I did that and it was, to me, a huge victory.\"\n\nIn May 2000, she became the first woman to join the ASPW board. During her three-year run on the ASPW, she spearheaded the push for expanded farmworker rights. \"There has been so much focus on the need for food and water. It's really been the responsibility of every American to feed their families in dignity and dignity and with dignity,\" she says. \"And my vision was to bring this concept to the people's attention so that we could take action on issues that really mattered. It was my vision for the ASPW, and for food, to do that without a single vote and without any one person's leadership.\"\n\nThe ASPW began to expand throughout the country in 2005 and helped form a coalition that had already grown to more than 1,100 members. \"The most important thing from a policy perspective is that no political party is going to take on the other side of this issue that's so important to the people of the United States of America,\" says Karen Pugh, then an AVPW worker. \"All sides need to be in full swing because even without one political party in the party that has taken this step, there's a lot of work to be done.\"\n\nBut despite these efforts, no one has been able to win the campaign. Despite the efforts of some who have tried, Kaitlin is still trying to reach out to a large number of labor organizations who are working on similar issues: the farmers' union, workers' organization, agribusiness groups, and more. This month, Kaitlin's office announced that it will meet with a number of major food companies on Nov. 29 to seek information about food workers in the US.\n\nWith Pugh, Pugh and her partner at the time, Lora Cushing, Kaitlin and Tewksbury Community Federation are looking for organizations committed to making food workers a voice in our local communities. \"I'm in a race against time when most people don't understand that at a minimum, I'm going to say NO to getting any food from farmers. I don't believe in it until I'm in that situation. And I think there's never been a time as bad I've felt in my life as I did when I made promises to the world, when I went out and said 'I hope that this is not going to be a problem for my family. I want to build it with your support,' \" she says.\n\n\"We want people to know I'm not a big food critic. I'm saying I want to be in every aspect of food production,\" she continues. \"I want food to exist for the people in every farm and we want it to be for you. When the food I want is delivered to you from farms that have already been done, when a food factory has been shut down and the local farmer's market is closed to the public, I'm doing it. I'm fighting for change, for fair trade rules for food. I don't believe in the politicians.", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

It discusses how they managed to make a successful case for the legitimacy of the \"Soviet Model of Social Justice\", and how they developed this model within the democratic processes of which both parties have an extremely strong political power. The book contains links to more than 90 independent research papers, all of which are available on the Internet. \"Marxists\" is a very unique title given the nature of some of the literature in this work and because it is based directly on the work of Marx, it contains many of the most important and popular elements. You can read about this important text in many of the more than 200 papers published in this volume. The authors are: Professor of Socialist Renewal at Harvard, Professor of Socialist Renewal and Socialist Renewal at Yale, Robert L. Anderson and Paul G. DeKauff, and Professor of Civil Rights and Democracy at George Mason University. These papers cover much of the literature and are well researched and carefully researched. The book is not only critical of the Soviet system but also analyzes the policies of the Soviet leadership of the last three decades. It examines the social problems of the USSR, including its \"strategic and economic and diplomatic implications\". On the basis of these historical and socio-economic insights you can see the basis of some of the most important developments and decisions in the last four decades. It also discusses the new democratic process as an important aspect of the new \"socialist\" system. The book also covers fundamental issues in the early twentieth century, from the struggle for socialism throughout Europe to the \"socialist\" movement of the 1920s. In all parts of the world, we find clear examples of the influence of social democratic movements over the entire history of life, including the emergence of capitalism and the new socialist society. Many of the important developments in the history of the Soviet Union are also discussed and discussed within Marxist-Leninist circles around the world.\n\nA complete review of the major books on this subject.\n\nThis book will help you to understand the current Soviet policy and how it relates to other political and social issues which have arisen in the political arena or are still being experienced by members of the public. This is due to the tremendous pressure which the Soviet state has to put on other nations to achieve socialism and the influence it has felt upon their own political and social conditions. The book is therefore well suited for you in terms of how the Soviet Union used to operate and how it has dealt with problems which they did not seem to be dealing with at the time. All important aspects of their policy and the situation are also covered, including what they considered to be the correct and necessary policies to promote social equality.\n\nWritten by: Dr. George L. Anderson, a historian specializing in Soviet political and social issues. Professor of Political Science and Political Research at Rutgers University, and a professor of social movements at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.\n\nThe book is published by a company called the National Book Trust.

Hodgkinson, an active Trump supporter. \"We're all going to be gunned down by this anti-black group.\"\n\nAs a protest against racism and inequality, police have used a wide range of techniques, from planting their officers on young black people, to tear apart storefronts, tear them apart by firing teargas, to beat up a man as they stormed a McDonalds, to attack a woman in her white-tie dress, to hit up a man with an automatic rifle.\n\nBut in most cities after police officers have taken part in incidents of racism in Chicago, they are often outnumbered by Black people and are sometimes targeted with Tasers.\n\n\"Chicago is not just a ghetto. We're white and we're black,\" said Michael T. Taylor, president of the Chicago Black Lawyers Association, which represents law enforcement for all communities of color. \"It's an issue of inequality, and it's a huge issue of police racism.\"\n\nIn the past, black Chicagoans have taken to using racist language to protect themselves or their children:\n\n\"We're out there defending our city and our city and our city is in crisis.\"\n\n\"No more white police officers.\"\n\n\"No more black cops.\"\n\nThey've also used intimidation against Black people with racial slurs, like \"snoopy,snot-nosed,sucking\" and \"snowflake,\" or in support of lynching.\n\n\"We need to get on that one last train to Cleveland.\"\n\n\"No thanks.\"\n\n\"I'm a cop.

But that's part of the reason police are such bad enemies of the Black Lives Matter movement: they fear repercussions in the future.\n\nPolice departments are not always right as Black people claim, of course; many departments have been known to fire unarmed black men who are not carrying any kinds of badges and shields at all hours of the day or night. So many of the incidents are due to police departments' discriminatory policy toward Black people during times of violence, and in many cases, the city is now under fire for hiring racist employees, not just those black officers killed.\n\nLast year, an ordinance in Chicago passed that would have banned the city from hiring Black people on the job, but the ordinance was overturned in two weeks by Illinois Supreme Court justices William O. Douglas and Samuel T. Alito.\n\nIn the past year, several Black leaders from various political backgrounds have come out against any changes to Chicago's police department's approach to racial tensions. Among them are James T. Hodgkinson, who killed an elderly African American woman and injured a 16-year-old boy because he had no guns, and police chief Charlie Beck, who claimed that people who are unarmed \"are at it again.\"\n\n\"I think I've spent a little time in Chicago,\" said the black activist who is organizing a protest at the department headquarters Wednesday to speak out against police violence. \"I can see a pattern. This isn't a case where it's OK to make racist comments like that.\"\n\nFor many black people with an interest in civil rights, including many police officers and people who work at the department, police brutality is a way to shield them from scrutiny.\n\n\"A lot of black men have a hard time getting their rights,\" said Steve Satterley, a retired police chief in New York City, who was shot to death after an attack on a police station near an airport. \"You have a white officer in uniform killing a black man, he's on the run for a crime that he committed.\"\n\nBut there are serious and immediate repercussions for police officers who use racism as the justification; their actions are sometimes viewed as", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

In Manila alone, about 11 million people (35% of the population, or 21.8 million) live below the minimum wage. In the Philippines, there was a poverty rate of 10.5% in 2008, which is the highest in the world. According to the latest figures from the World Bank, poverty rates were highest the last few years of the current decade when the country had an annual poverty rate of 14.7%. This compares with the 17.6% observed in 2001.\n\nIn fact, the Philippines does see significant numbers of people living in poverty, with one in five people in poverty (about 4.5 million) living in poverty. For a population of 35.7 million people (35.5% of the total), that's a huge problem with only 21.6% (2.2 million) living in poverty in 2008 (see below).\n\nAccording to the OECD data, there are 1.6 million people in poverty in the Philippines today and only 1.6 million in the rest of the world.\n\nPoverty in a school system\n\nEducation\n\nThe Philippines does not have a universal school system. But it does have an elementary or secondary education system, which is called \"Pursuit of Progress\".\n\nThe Pursuit of Progress Program is the first of its kind in the Philippines. The program covers the entire nation from the provincial level, followed by an additional one kilometer of a local program of 12 miles long. Schools are built on urban infrastructure, in neighborhoods and along streets, but also on roads, bridges and public transport. In addition, it includes training courses that will not only teach students about working in a factory, but also provide them with an opportunity to take the most effective skills in the field of construction and construction engineering.\n\nPursuit of Progress is offered as scholarships to all members of the community of Filipinos who want to develop their skills in construction and infrastructure technology. Currently, only about 10% of the 1 million Filipinos living in the Philippines have completed any of the primary courses they are entitled to at the university.\n\nIn addition to high school education that students have available, the Pursuit of Progress program provides training courses in public or privately owned education. This means that some 5 million students in the Philippines live in schools that can teach them the fundamentals of building, construction and education.\n\nPursuit of Progress\n\nTeaching and Training\n\nPURPOSE\n\nPursuit of Progress is a universal, two-day program that is taught in schools from year to year. Classes are not conducted until March 31st (2018), but only about six percent of total classes (60) of high school students will be taught.\n\nThe program begins at the end of each school year and covers a total of 24 months of school year and provides up to 200 training courses, in one of 2,500 classrooms.\n\nTraining is divided into three classes:\n\nAdvanced: a program of five workshops;\n\nAdvanced Secondary: a program of 12 workshops; and\n\nAdvanced Placement classes that use the same language and methods.\n\nThis program was developed for a group of students who want to go to the school and teach at home so as to take advantage of more resources, more time and better education.\n\nPursuit of Progress is also an educational resource for all, who want to take up the technical level, as well as have their own school to learn different skills.\n\nPursuit of Progress is available to all: students of children and veterans with pre-existing health problems of their parents, grandparents or siblings who were not in school before completing high school.\n\nPursuit of Progress\n\nPursuit of Progress is the first program of the kind in the world in which all children of the Philippine society will be treated equally or equally in the care of their parents, grandparents or siblings.\n\nPursuit of Progress is available to all:\n\nMali\u00f1os (migrants)\n\nTayang (takoyo)\n\nMukenji (Mali\u00f1os)\n\nPursuit of Progress", "length": 911, "ended": true}

This morning, the Patriots are in their second season in the NFL and coach Bill Belichick called upon his entire team to continue playing against the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference, Belichick reiterated that the team will have a week of practice on Sunday, and added that the Patriots are looking forward to their first team game against the New York Giants over the next few weeks in the Bahamas. The Patriots are also scheduled to practice with the New England coaching staff in New Haven early in the weekend as well.\n\nFollowing Belichick's comments, one of the most commonly asked questions about the entire situation came from a viewer.\n\n\"Is anybody out here saying they're not going to return to the team if things don't turn out the way they want?\"\n\n\"Not one player is back in the locker room,\" noted an employee at the local newspaper. \"No one's saying they're ready to come back.

He also gave out a motivational call for his team's homecoming team.\n\n\"I'm not going to get into an argument with you, that's for sure. So what I'm saying is, what I've said over the years is this is exactly the same as when you're coaching the Patriots. You have a team that knows when to go back to the game. When you're at an important time like when I am here, where I know the right guy, when I am here as a coach. And so I have the chance to lead that team to the Super Bowl,\" he said.\n\nThe Patriots' decision not to return to the team is certainly not indicative of the team's confidence in him, as we reported earlier this month.

The first one posted it as \"no links\" and says only that its only online dating service for men and women, not \"all other services that involve the same topic or dating experience.\"\n\nThe second site also posted that even if you didn't find it on a dating site, you should be prepared to meet somebody in person and try to find out more about their hobbies or interests.\n\nThat makes all the more sense. I asked a few other dating sites and their responses gave us a little more information than this. The first one posted it as \"no links\" and says only that its only online dating service for men and women, not \"all other services that involve the same topic or dating experience.\"\n\nThe most interesting answer came from a Reddit user who asks specifically about dating, a topic that has been hotly debated online. A user named \"CuriousHornie\" suggested to me there may be better dating sites out there.\n\nThere are lots of other dating sites to look into, but the only one I found were the ones that did offer full-on dating.com services, or you could just go to Tinder and search for the person from any location. I found myself searching more and more for anyone.\n\nWhat it did show, according to Reddit commenter \"Prayer_Fucking_Finder,\" were the people who were genuinely interested and willing to talk. They talked about other things related to dating but didn't actually share their specific interests. Their focus wasn't on \"what you love about someone,\" but just about everything that they were willing to talk about.\n\nPrayer_Fucking_Finder found that people from all genders and sexualities talk to others about things other than themselves too, and also talked about their favorite movies, music or movies.\n\nPrayer_Fucking_Finder found that women are more open to talking, that men in general are more open to talking, that women think things through rather than talk about them.\n\nPrayer_Fucking_Finder found that in general, men were more open to getting information from people who share their sexual preferences, while women were less likely to be open to getting information from men.\n\nPrayer_Fucks_Finder found that the men who were more open to talking about women were slightly less likely to tell anyone they are a feminist, while men who were less likely to say things about gender equality were quite likely to tell anyone they are a feminist either in a friendly or adversarial way.\n\nHere are just a few of these examples of the various responses I came across:\n\nCuriousHornie: \"What's it like being a feminist in the tech industry? \"\n\nPrayer_Fucking_Finder: \"I guess it takes some of the pain out of me.\"\n\nCuriousHornie: \"You've probably been working really hard in the tech industry.

It appears that at least part of this problem stems from how many of these crimes seem committed without anyone taking time to stop.\n\nSo, if this is what law enforcement looks like, why should we think that law enforcement should only stop a small percentage of crimes if they were all caused by a small number of criminals?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo get an idea, look at the number of days during which crimes were investigated that led to arrests. That number has climbed steadily from one-third of all crimes investigated in 2009 to half of what it was in 1995.\n\nThat means the number of violations of crime-related civil rights statutes has grown from about 1.5 million in 1995 to almost 1.25 million. And then there's the fact that this increase comes as much of a response from cops, police unions and many others, who like to believe that even when they're doing their job, if an activity is going to get a little bit of publicity, it will lead to people's lives being taken away from them.\n\nSo why don't cops just say if you're a criminal or an accessory to a crime, you have it in your hands to stop that act?

{"id": 250073, "text": "A small group of Americans who have made up less than 1 percent of the population since the early 1990s has decided to take action to help combat climate change.\n\nSome of the more conservative, mostly black communities\u2014in states like South Carolina, Montana, Wyoming and Oregon\u2014have joined a movement aimed at fighting the problem by voting against Obama's climate plan, the Environmental Protection Agency's decision to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and the release of federal regulations that are expected to slow the pace of global warming. The groups are called Generation Policy Initiative, Generation Surge and Generation Recovery.\n\nIn a statement, the group, which has garnered a record 40,000 signatures in more than five years, said President Obama's policies should have been \"based on science and not on dogma and science is not the answer.\"\n\n\"Our goal is to save more than a billion dollars on carbon dioxide emissions by building on the work of generations,\" said Jay E. Wackenhutt, the group's director. \"The action we're taking now is important because it is a bold step toward a global community to work together to advance a more just, sustainable future for our planet.\"\n\nThe group has long been a proponent of the \"2040 Agenda,\" in which the United States seeks to cut greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, from the energy mix and reduce the size of our energy mix, by 2025. But it's also long held that most of the emissions from coal and oil used in America come from the United States, which has the world's biggest greenhouse gas budget. The group recently moved from its original goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to 2025 and said a plan to start cutting greenhouse gas emissions \"might change that\" by next year or two as the U.S. does not have time to absorb enough of the nation's carbon footprint.\n\nThe new group's action comes less than a month after the White House proposed reversing President Obama's efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 75 to 80 percent from 1990 levels for 10 years by building on the work of generations. The EPA also reversed the EPA's climate plans back in 2015, moving to cut the amount of carbon in the atmosphere from 80 to 70 percent by 2020.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency took control of the rule change Monday, and the decision could end up being one of several environmental impacts the EPA may face as it works with a group to make changes on federal spending, energy efficiency rules, and the economy. The agency will spend up $800 million in 2015 from the federal budget to reduce the rate of temperature rise by 20 to 30 degrees.\n\nLast year, the Obama administration announced plans to cut the rate of carbon dioxide emissions by 28 percent by 2030 from the current 30 to 40 percent. That's much more than the agency has already done, as the United States has reduced its emissions over the century, but the United States will reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that rises at the end of the century from just 20 to 25 percent by 2050.\n\nThe change in the Clean Power Plan, the plan that aims to make the United States the world's leading carbon-trading power by the end of the century, will be the largest single U.S. action by far from the EPA. The agency has proposed reducing the EPA's emissions by 100,000 tons in 2025, as required by the new plan.\n\nIt still faces opposition from some conservatives, who fear the EPA's work and action on climate change will cause the nation to become \"a nation of redneck power brokers.\"\n\nOpponents of the Clean Power Plan argue that the agency has made climate change more of a problem for the U.S. and put some of its \"costs\" at the disposal of politicians that don't want to spend any money. \"We can't afford to lose the American economy and all of its jobs,\" said former Sen. John Cornyn, the Texas Republican who proposed an amendment to the EPA's rules. \"This is the wrong way to take your business to the American people.\"\n\nIn a March 15 speech in West Virginia, former House Speaker John Boehner offered his own critique of the plan and defended it Monday as an example of \"America's past mistakes, and the American future we all deserve.\"\n\n\"I have a strong feeling that this White House has been deliberately manipulating the EPA in order to achieve its purpose of cutting costs so that more Americans don't make the same mistakes on the jobs and other priorities in the future,\" he said.\n\nThe EPA may be an especially tough spot given the agency still has not set a deadline to implement its new rule that removes some of Obama's most important climate agenda changes \u2014 like ending fossil fuel subsidies by 2020.\n\nBoehner offered up a list of key climate change change policy recommendations that he and other conservatives have long advocated\u2014including an accelerated removal of regulation based on science, and an international agreement between countries to combat global warming, while also ending regulation through the draft rules, which were developed in recent years by the", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

As we prepare for our big debut later this year we have a goal of raising $5K and have raised $10K through your donation and online donation. The rest of the money will go towards training and equipment. Our goal for 2017 will be to do a music show which will give listeners an opportunity to share their thoughts about music and help create a new musical community.\n\nThis is a large amount of money for us to go on. We hope everybody enjoys the event.\n\n\nThe venue is the same spot, and if you would be interested in getting a ticket to see the show you may also be interested in going to the event at the venue on your own.\n\nHow a show is set up\n\nThe venue is rented. It costs $20 to show up. If you want to show on your own it costs $20. Most of it will be spent on equipment and the music is made up of some 3 different tracks. Every time your show is put on, your crowd of 50 (the people who got the show) will sing or chant along. It seems that the biggest thing that keeps us going this time is the support and donations which will come along the way. So if you are in need of something done during a show, please send an email and ask if we would be able to help.\n\nThe cost is $10 per person. If you are willing to buy your own equipment, please send an email to us and we will give you some information on how much each person will be paying at the show. We will then give you up to $40 of that and you will then have the option to purchase your own or with others for the same price as the stage. The cost for a booth is $25. You are only charged if you have a reservation. In a community event you charge a fee of one per person. You must pay at least one percent of the amount on your advance payment to enter.\n\nCost of a stage or booth\n\nAll proceeds will be spent at the event where you are allowed to present your tickets to the public. Most of the proceeds will go towards staffing costs. We have set a goal of raising $5K so we will be having to allocate as much as possible.\n\nHow to participate\n\nThere will be a registration opening at the door for the show. There is a good chance that there will be a line of people waiting. We will have a team on hand who will help out from the start. Our next goal will be to have a song that we think of as a love song. We are looking forward to seeing the song and will be sure to provide you a picture. If you plan on coming to the show, please send me a friend or call my office at (434-737-3100). We also encourage all who wish to donate money to the event to do so.\n\n\nWhen will the event be?\n\nThere are about 15 people in town, and they will get the chance to participate at one time when they arrive at the venue. This is a smaller venue and you will have time to bring your own food and drinks. We will get a few hours of music before we have the rest of the music in the room.\n\n\nHow to get tickets\n\nWe will be on the 10 minute walk over to their entrance via a very scenic path. There is a line of two people at the gate. You will pick up the tickets after the event but have to pick up tickets from a vending machine and put them onto the bus.\n\nHow to purchase tickets\n\nYou will need to purchase tickets at the station for both the one ticket and the tickets for the rest of the day. There is a fee to book but that is waived as we have a limited amount of available tickets.\n\nHow do I get tickets?\n\nThere are two options available to you: online from the stand by, or with a phone number from a local business\n\nOnline:\n\nThe day before the show, you can choose to have your own phone booth at the stand by or at a convenience store.

While the next few, \"The Last Jedi,\" \"The Last Jedi: The Force Awakens\" and \"The Avengers\" are planned (along with next summer's \"Thor\") on film, fans are wondering if these are going to be released as separate episodes. In the latest one of these, the \"Halloween\"/\"The Last Jedi\" trailer just debuted, there is this.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has a long history with the franchise starring Kevin Feige, James Earl Jones and Benedict Cumberbatch as a group of ninjas that are led by a Jedi named Jaina Babbitt who takes control of a ship, the Millennium Falcon, and begins taking them over. It can be very confusing. Some characters take up to six hours of their lives during a trip to space after learning that they have been given a virus to help them return to Earth. This is a game-changer for fans of the series.\n\nThe answer is, that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is going to introduce Star Wars characters from the \"Star Wars\" films. The answer, of course, is that while the Marvel Universe is focused on the franchise in a large and growing number of ways this week, these characters have to be included in \"Halloween\"/\"The Last Jedi: The Force Awakens,\" the latest installment in a series of new series. For the uninitiated the show will have a couple of new characters joining its ranks that will be playing the part over the next several weeks in the film.\n\nOne of these three characters I'm looking at are Luke Cage, and while he's been an established part of the original trilogy in recent seasons, he was reprising his role as a young kid playing on an \"I-Beak for the Beast\" (see above) and coming across as a very cool character in the movies. The character also had an interesting backstory back in the '80s and '90s.\n\nThe other three main characters I'm looking at are Luke Cage (Ruthless), Luke Cage (The Phantom Menace), and Cage (Luke Cage vs. Starkiller Base). There's the very cool Marvel Cinematic Universe villain and the very cool Spider-Man (which is also the character who's most famous for playing off-brand Tony Stark), and there's an old Star Wars movie where the character actually fought for his home planet of Earth in the Millennium Falcon.\n\nThe \"The Last Jedi\" trailer also shows one main character that had a big part in the new \"Ghostbusters\" franchise. There is an old trailer of Chris Hemsworth. For those of you not familiar with the character, Hemsworth is now in his fifth movie and has been a staple of Marvel's blockbuster heroes. And, he has a very good shot of joining the \"Star Wars\" franchise by appearing in the film.\n\n\nAnd the \"X-Men\"/\"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" movie, which will also have an X-Men connection that may be played by a character we don't know much about. Just recently we reported that the Marvel Entertainment properties planned to launch the sequel to \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" were moving past that to start \"the future and not the past.\" A short time later, we reported that the studio had decided that it would start with the X-Men, and began to take a much more aggressive approach to sequels due to Star Wars. But, it was a long time ago and, at this point we aren't at the point where this is news. But at the moment, many believe that if anything, these \"X-Men\" movies may not be as big a deal as they once were. After all, the first \"X-Men\" movie was a hit, but it never had a big impact on American film culture. And, the new \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" movie is going to be an even bigger hit.\n\nIn the meantime, we continue to follow this new series and we'll be bringing you updates and more in the coming days as we get close to the \"next chapter of the 'Return of the Jedi' saga.\"\n\nStay tuned \u2013 The Inquisitr will keep you updated with everything from upcoming projects and new films in our \"The Last Jedi\" section.\n\nSource\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nPinterest\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nReddit\n\nTumblr\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\n\nPrint\n\n\nPocket", "length": 954, "ended": true}

Rinaldi of the Salt Lake City, Utah, office. \"The Church would not acknowledge or support any and all religion under any circumstances.\"\n\nAnd the church said its mission \"is an independent, private organization and not a government entity.\"\n\n\"The lawsuit simply reflects serious confusion among Latter-day Saint leaders about LDS church members' ability to be fully aware of all aspects of the Catholic Church and to participate fully in the mission of the Church,\" said Rinaldi.\n\nIn his letter to Elder Dallin H. Oaks on Oct. 11, Elder Oaks noted that he is \"well aware of every court order of the Church, and I share your faith in its authority,\" and that he \"will continue to engage with the issues that we believe are important, in such as cases as they concern my church, my church's mission, and my own life.\"\n\nBut Oaks says any litigation against LDS leaders will be handled by church officials.\n\n\"The Church and its governing officials will be responsible for all court actions against such litigation. I will be particularly concerned if our church has received formal orders from a government authority regarding their conduct during this litigation,\" he said in his letter. \"To that end, I think we need to carefully consider whether or not the Church has complied with the law regarding lawsuits in court and whether or not the Church has done so on any reasonable suspicion that the allegations are false.\"\n\nThe lawsuit in South Carolina accuses Church members of being \"imprisoned for having no belief in Christ,\" but it claims the charges are politically motivated.\n\n\"It appears that some Mormons have been forced to participate in the Church mission program because the Church is not allowed to control all aspects of its affairs,\" said Rinaldi in his letter.\n\nHe added that he would ask church leaders to review their policies with regard to such lawsuits.\n\nRinaldi also said Mormons should \"never give any other form of legal advantage to an organization that is doing anything to deny them basic doctrinal or political rights by attempting to deny them any rights at all. \u2026 I am not going to allow church leaders to use the status quo of discrimination against all people as part of their legal strategy for dealing with them. The Church has always stood firmly against discrimination in any form whatsoever, not just the religious issues in which it is engaged.\"\n\nThe LDS Church issued a statement to the Post saying that \"even if people believe and practice the Church's beliefs independently of the claims of church leadership, the Church clearly violates the First Amendment when it seeks to deny or promote any religion on the grounds that such beliefs are not true.\"\n\nA church spokesman could not be reached for comment.\n\nDorothy D.

{"id": 250082, "text": "The government was on a tight budget last week. It would no doubt struggle to get through Christmas to its first budget this winter, including the $25 billion annual deficit. This is just the tip of the iceberg since it's not a major priority for Prime Minister David Cameron. The government wants the next budget by March to contain this budget deficit (as it did last year) but the budget is already far smaller.\n\nAs a result, it's tough to see how Cameron could come to an agreement with the government. There will be a number of issues, such as his ability to deliver on a pledge to cut the deficit by $1.25 trillion (that's 20%). Meanwhile, it's probably not going to be enough to get the Budget's 2017 budget through its Christmas break. If Cameron wanted the budget for his government to be a credible one he would have to start with a budget for the economy.\n\nSo if you want to start looking forward to Christmas, then perhaps you should do some things. The government should start making announcements early next month that it wants to increase the government's debt level and take measures to keep inflation under control. It's also likely that the government will make sure that some of its spending programs are covered.\n\nOn the economy, the government also needs to make an adjustment to the spending caps in order to reach a more consistent budget. A recent report from the International Monetary Fund estimated that the economy would need about $250 billion in funding over ten years, and that the country needs about $1 trillion in spending over ten years to achieve that, and that those increases are likely to fall well below expectations of the budget.\n\nOne way or another, the government could look to get new contracts and incentives through the year. The government will likely also face a new policy issue if it is to keep the long term interest rates at all. There is also the risk that it will be forced to increase its borrowing costs to cover its budget borrowing costs while it cuts the budget deficit.\n\nThe government did a very good job of getting some of its budget plans through earlier this year.\n\nWe know that the current budget deficit is not quite over $1 trillion (it was $15.7 trillion last year). That is, because there is no real debt burden to address. The government has a chance of getting some of the more optimistic spending levels into surplus over the next quarter or so. In other words, it should be able to get the budget back into surplus by 2018. But even if it does get it to the next quarter of the year, it has a much better chance of making the next budget a reasonable one than not. The debt-ridden government needs to come out of the hole before the fiscal year begins in October 2019 to bring the debt down and prevent it from taking even more money out of the pockets of those that have been hit by the financial crisis.\n\nThe government also still needs another $40 billion to meet the debt limit if it wants to get through Christmas. This is because the government is currently going to have to spend another $4.9 trillion (including the $16.3 trillion in tax revenues paid by taxpayers) to pay the $1 billion in capital gains tax rate needed to pay down the capital gains taxes. It's already in place and will continue to be if there is any money left.\n\nWhen we asked why the government will spend $4.9 trillion in capital gains, some responses were pretty straightforward. They pointed out that while the target would seem reasonable to most federal voters (those with income more than $30,000) and most government employees, it's really not. They pointed out that most of the money the government would save from the tax cuts it'd already already get through the year isn't coming from capital gains income tax revenues. (People don't know about deductions, so we didn't take any of those questions and simply didn't ask about capital gains income tax revenue.) They pointed out that the money, if any, would have to come from the existing budget to do the rest of the spending in the new year or it'd have to be paid for by higher interest rates. Finally, they pointed out that it could take a lot longer for the new year to go forward, especially for those under 65.\n\nAt first glance, they had a pretty solid argument on capital gains taxes. After all, some of the money collected there doesn't necessarily go to the taxpayers to be spent as it is. So, we can assume that the money would just stay in the hands of the government for the next period of time \u2014 probably by a much longer period of time.\n\nSome of those people, however, were more optimistic.\n\nMany of those people cited the fact that the current target has been set at $1.25 trillion (roughly the cost of borrowing more than $4.9 trillion). They also cited how low the target is and were quite happy about the way the government is negotiating. Most of those people were happy", "length": 1024, "ended": false}
{"id": 250083, "text": "A couple of months ago, the Supreme Court ruled that a right to same-sex marriages is protected because it was enshrined in the U.S. constitution. However, we still have little information on specific aspects of the law, if any, and there are still a couple of big questions about what this ruling means.\n\nFirst, what are the types of laws that the majority finds to be unconstitutional?\n\nThe most widely known ones are Sections 11 and 14 of the U.S. Constitution. Section 11 specifically protects state's ability to refuse to recognize same-sex marriage. Section 14 allows the states to decide what forms of marriage are acceptable under certain circumstances.\n\nIt's not clear what those types of laws mean to anyone who is not of legal age, but I think the legal requirements are more stringent than what's in the Constitution. Section 11 goes into effect next March.\n\nBut how does this apply to states that want to recognize same-sex marriages, who is not eligible to marry legally? And why has the U.S. courts not even legalized same-sex marriage? The court recently declined a challenge to a Texas law to grant an anti-gay legal status to same-sex couples who have a religious objection to same-sex couples or are married during the same-sex wedding ceremony. That law, known as AB 1051, is a partial answer here, but not the most direct. It also doesn't provide anyone enough legal guidance, the court explained in a ruling.\n\nLet's take a look at a few of the broad legal rulings (here and here), because they're pretty striking.\n\nTitle IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Article I, Section 7): This provision forbids discrimination based on sex. Basically, it allows states to deny benefits to people based on the sex of the applicant, but not the sex of the person who performed the act. As we've shown, those same rights were recognized by the Supreme Court in two cases, in North Carolina and in Illinois, and by the Court in another case, in California. In both cases, those protections had been based only on the sex of the applicant, not the sex of the person involved. In both cases, those rights also were protected by the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution: If a state's law did not address a gender identity, then the protections for people who are transgender were inadequate, and the \"right\" to marry or be married could not be guaranteed. The Court also looked at the broader language used here and in the rest of the law: Title IX \"requires every state, including small towns, to provide equal protections\" for its citizens, and to \"provide equal opportunities for all persons of the same sex, regardless of their gender in employment.\" These things are in the Constitution today and have been in our nation for over half a century. They were not even the part of the Constitution.\n\nArticle V of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Article I, Division 6): In an opinion authored by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court held, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is unconstitutional under \u00a75 of the Civil Rights Act \"if not implemented. ... \" The Court goes on to say that \"[t]he Voting Rights Act of 1965 (which, like many other parts of the law, was intended to address a particular racial category rather than a particular national group) ... would be a step toward the complete repeal of 's the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which, when implemented, would deprive all the 50 states, including black, of the opportunity to elect their citizens to the Federal government, even when it is not legally feasible and appropriate to do so\". What do a State and a State can do to reverse Title IX, which requires every state, including small towns, to provide equal benefits for people who have been discriminated against for a certain color, gender or age based on their sexual orientation, and who were not, so long as they were still allowed to have marital benefits, with their choice of employer, family, social safety net and healthcare benefits if they chose. In other words, because the law only applies to the United States, not the rest of the world. We, then, must turn a blind eye to this law. Under what conditions could a party who is not eligible to marry or be married discriminate against a citizen of a State who would not be allowed to use these benefits? The answer is simple: they can't be. What state must they be in order to exercise these privileges?\n\nSo what does this mean? There are three things we think about it, the first being that, \"Title IX does not prevent the states in the general area of the federal government from creating new national and local laws requiring recognition for certain classes of individuals.\" I think of such laws almost interchangeably throughout this whole article, and we agree with Justice Scalia very much, in this case.\n\nThe second is that our society is living in a time where discrimination has become more entrenched.

It hosts an enormous complex of tunnels that have been built around the ruins of an ancient dwarven civilization. As a base of operations, though, the Temple of Kings has been abandoned by the Lord of Thunder. As such, some of what remains of the structure are in some form of a museum or museum or museum hall. The fortress itself is not particularly large (about five hundred meters tall), and there has been no public access to it since its abandonment. It is not built to contain a large group of players, although many of the players who have chosen to reside here will return once the Temple of Kings is built to an even larger degree. The ruins of the fortress are much larger, containing many of the many chambers or chambers that the Temple itself has served. The only two major entrances to the Palace of Thunder were discovered and excavated by Saradomin, who then installed the statue of Lord Tharion on the ruins, which were used to transport players back to the Temple in time after the fall of the city[1].\n\nThe Temple of Kings was an important place for many players in Morrowind during the last years of the Second Era, and has a unique role to play in the game. It is also, it appears, part of the Palace of Thunder.[2]\n\nThe temple of kings is one of the six sacred sites scattered throughout the entire city of Morrowind. A large portion of the temple consists wholly of stables, caves, cottages, and other buildings, and is composed entirely of earth. It is the centre of the game, being at its apex, as opposed to the other four places in Skyrim (Horde, Mines, Mines of Unsullied and the Mines of Unsullied).[3] While it lies in the middle of the center of Morrowind, it is also called the city of Kings, and is the site of the most significant temple of Oblivion.[4][5]\n\nAt its apex, the Temple of Kings is the first of the six Temple of Kings, as it is the tallest temple with the largest central structure.[6] The Temple of Kings was built by the Lord of Thunder in the reign of the Dark Lord in 3031,[7] before the Great Sundering and is the last one of the Four Temple buildings.[8] The entire Temple of Kings is composed of ruins, from one of the largest of Morrowind's Great Shores, the Tower Temple, which stood on a ridge when the Great Sundering occurred,[9] when the city was divided into three great sections, and was later used for an Imperial city.[10] It was destroyed when the Imperials besieged the city after the Great Sundering.\n\nThe Shadowmoon Citadel was built after the destruction of the Great Sun, in the Era of the End, and was part of the Imperial palace for more than 40,000 years.[11] It is the final base of Temple of Kings[12] and serves as the stronghold of a large empire that has held sway over the area ever since it was built. Despite this, it has always been believed that it is the oldest temple in the game, and has never been rebuilt.[13] It has never been rebuilt, and when it is rebuilt again, it replaces the ruins of the Great Sun.[14]\n\nThe Temple of Kings was made from wood used by the Lord of Thunder to create the Great Sun,[15] although it was abandoned after the Dark Lord left the building.[16] During the time of the Great Sundering, some of the ruins were used in rebuilding the temple.[17]\n\nNotable Quests [ edit ]\n\nThe following quests reward the player with the Dark Brotherhood's first three Dark Brotherhood books and a Dark Brotherhood companion book for the player.\n\nThe Great Sun's Great Seal (1)\n\nThe Great Sun, in the Great City, is a giant, giant cathedral in the distance that serves as the gateway to Skyrim, but is the first of the seven great temples to be built.[18] The Great Sun is an ancient, mysterious source of knowledge.[19] In 3034, an apprentice of Tharion, a great mage, died, when the Temple of Kings was destroyed and the Great Sun was buried. It was eventually rebuilt under his leadership.\n\nIn 4054, the city was evacuated and the Great Sun was rebuilt under the leadership of Morag Tong in the City-Centre.[20] The Great Sun was now an archipelago, and the Great City of Morrowind was abandoned until Morrowind's end.[21] Many of the ruins of the Great Sun are seen in High Rock in Morrowind.

The FBI has now arrested a Florida woman and charged her with wire-tapping and other crimes.\n\nAccording to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the incident was captured on surveillance cameras for the Washington, D.C.-based FBI. The FBI has been working on a possible plea deal with the former president's family about charges against her.\n\nThe FBI is not in a position to comment.\n\nIn addition, the FBI has also stopped at least two other homes with an FBI agent stationed at home, after reports were first reported of multiple cases in Florida.\n\nHere are three more details from a story we obtained Monday morning about Hillary Clinton's possible escape from a Florida home:\n\nClinton left her Washington, D.C.-area home on Sunday, according to news reports. She was accompanied by federal agents, according to the AP and multiple media outlets. Police confirmed the arrest from a local D.C. news station. The agent assigned to the home was \"acting as a private investigator,\" according to the news outlet, which broke the story early Monday morning.\n\nAs we reported here at The Washington Post, U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Agents for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recently released a video from the residence.\n\nThe video shows a young man walking the lawn with his family and asking a question. It's not clear how long the man has been traveling, or when in which state he's on holiday, the reporter later reports at the time.\n\nThe agent is also seen saying \"you'll have another day.\"\n\nIn a video posted to YouTube by a man with the handle \"Sawr,\" the agent says, \"you'll have another chance.\"\n\nIn the video, he then makes the question to a man sitting next to a flower, asking him whether he likes her hair back (also, does it look like a natural hair cut) or not. At that moment, he walks over to the man and asks for a \"yes.\" In a different video, the agent says, \"You'll have another day.\"\n\nThe camera then shows Clinton on vacation on the beach with family members with a dog as she enters her Florida residence.\n\nThe camera then shows a man with her head in the sand, saying, \"I want to stay at your place,\" and then walks away. The video ends with her on the beach, apparently at the invitation, not knowing it was a part of her vacation.\n\nThe video does not mention her whereabouts.\n\nIn a report we obtained Monday morning, the AP first reported on Clinton's possible escape.\n\nWhile a Secret Service agent was at the scene, a female Secret Service agent said \"someone asked what was going on and they said she wanted to know what was going on.\"\n\nAnother agent from her agency told us that at the time \"the man said he just wanted to stay at the house and see if she was allowed back\" (she did not).\n\nAt that point, the woman said, \"She is probably asking you, 'Do I like it?' \"\n\nAccording to the AP, the woman also said the FBI was at the home and that her mother had told her she would have it over.\n\nThe AP has added a little more context in describing the encounter:\n\nOn an airplane with two Secret Service agents at Florida's State Fair, agents were spotted arriving at the property for a flight after the Secret Service was alerted. Some agents were seen taking video of an escape attempt on board the plane.\n\nIt's unclear if Clinton and other Democratic presidential candidates were aboard the aircraft during her time with the Secret Service, and it is possible her parents did not return the helicopter, or if they were not, but we know the Secret Service agents at the time were there for the interview \u2014 not the actual investigation. The agents are currently being treated at a local hospital.\n\nFBI agents had not been informed of an escape attempt in Florida since they arrived at the property for an airport interview on Aug. 19, a week after Clinton was captured by Secret Service.\n\nBut on Monday, former FBI Director James Comey said at a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing that information about Clinton's potential escape \"may have been known to the FBI because of that episode.\" On Tuesday at an FBI press briefing, James Comey testified the agency was \"aware of some information about a possible escape attempt that may have occurred or not occurred. And the FBI has conducted an internal investigation and I don't expect the situation to change in the immediate future without the full cooperation of the FBI.\"\n\nThe FBI, however, will keep up a regular watch on the case and possibly ask for interviews on the case.\n\nThe FBI and Secret Service have said in interviews that they do have a limited role in the case but that the agents involved are only acting at their own", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 250094, "text": "(NaturalNews) The Supreme Court on Thursday took the longest possible step away from a highly controversial federal law that requires religious schools to follow the state's definition of same-sex marriage: the Obergefell decision.The decision comes after nearly two years of legal battles and a series of landmark rulings made by a majority of states that define marriage rights for same-sex couples. A majority in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Obergefell on Thursday, saying the law's religious freedom protections do not apply to their schools.And while conservative religious leaders in states ranging from Wisconsin to Iowa blasted the decision, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to take that to heart.In his opinion, the court explained why the Supreme Court would overturn this \"crucifixion\" precedent.It also explained why it doesn't make any sense to redefine marriage in the first place.The court stated that it is difficult to argue that a college or university is \"not subject to the Due Process Clause,\" which states that the government cannot force a college or university to do something that a school is not required to do, except that a decision has to be made \"from the heart.\"This court found that the \"religious freedom doctrine\" is incompatible with the First Amendment because the school has been subjected to state policy, even under their stated views, that allow for gay marriage.The court also stated that the decision by the court may not be binding because the Supreme Court doesn't yet have the time or inclination to reach a conclusion on the matter, meaning that it would take about six months to decide on a case.But in the meantime, states nationwide will soon have to decide whether to continue with allowing gay marriage despite the Supreme Court's rulings.The 4th Circuit justices on Thursday said the religious freedom law does not prohibit religious schools from allowing same-sex couples to marry. They said the law does not address the fundamental constitutional rights of individuals, and that, despite the fact that the right of all people to choose to participate in the marriage is not part of the First Amendment.But, they added, the law does include a provision that allows employers and employers' contractors to discriminate against gay sex workers.But when the court first addressed the issue in April in a series of decisions that concluded that same-sex couples who perform abortions are not protected by the Constitution, it struck down the law, concluding, \"The right of every person to enjoy his or her own life is not violated by state law when it is exercised in the ordinary course of his or her private life.\"Roberts went on to describe the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell as a \"tremendous victory that, among its many accomplishments, ensures that our society can continue to live in an environment of equality while protecting religious freedom throughout the United States.\"The order was authored by Chief Justice John Roberts II and the lone dissenter, Elena Kagan, who wrote an opinion.The Supreme Court had not yet made a decision on whether to take up the Obergefell case before it comes up for appeal.\"We might have to wait for the next couple of years for that to be decided, but we do know here and elsewhere that the people of the seven states that have legalized marriage are not only religious but also, in a way, not just religious, at times of constitutional crisis,\" Roberts said.\"The question here is whether or not the law is 'crucified,'\" said Stephen Moore, a senior fellow working in the conservative Georgetown Law Center. \"Does it have any legal precedent and, if so, does it have a substantial impact on the constitutionality of this constitutional right?\"Moore asked of this law. \"In other words, it looks like a right. Does it take a state law to determine where it belongs and give it that power? And do those decisions come on the heels of the Obergefell decision?\"Moore said. \"These are serious challenges. The Obergefell decision is a really important example, but it could not have been a state law.\"Moore pointed to the fact that the Ohio Department of Criminal Justice did a study analyzing the Obergefell case with Alabama and Texas. Those two states are scheduled to hear arguments about the law on May 2 in the high court.\"If it were a state law now, that would be a real win for Ohio and Texas,\" Moore said.But, he continued, the Supreme Court is \"not ready yet\" to decide about Obergefell cases.\"The Supreme Court takes the issue of constitutional issues very seriously,\" said Roberts. \"It certainly is on the side of the religious liberty movement, in particular those over the issue of same-sex marriage.\"Roberts said he was \"particularly delighted\" by the ruling, but said he hoped that all five justices would take a look at the issue of religious liberty in a future case.The 5-4 opinion was the latest in a series of rulings by the 7th Circuit that have been followed closely for some time.The 4th Circuit and three of the remaining three conservative justices, including Chief Justice Roberts, have upheld a federal", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 250102, "text": "\nThe Federal Reserve had begun issuing its first \"welcome note\" last December after the housing market opened up at the start of October when demand slowed from an early low but kept going up.\n\nDuring Fed governor Ben Bernanke's term, the Bank of Japan raised interest rates slightly during the first six months of that year but kept them at zero until September 2008, an event which caused the rate to spike. While that action was supposed to have raised inflation expectations as much as a foot by mid-2009, as we discussed in our October 9 article, the central bank didn't stop short of raising its goal.\n\nThen-Fed Fed Deputy Chairman William Dudley pushed forward, saying \"I think the time to raise interest rates is now. So let's start and wait until the interest rate rises.\"\n\nThis meant a bit of a wait. Then on September 30, 2009 the money market started to rise for the first time in seven years with a target of raising more than 1% a year from the previous year. So now that the market has stabilized, most of the interest rates that should be raising by September have jumped, despite the initial increase.\n\nNow that the Fed is making its move, inflation is up. As we've discussed many times before, the Fed is looking to raise it as often as possible to keep the economy running. So instead of increasing interest rates, the Fed is setting its sights on raising rates in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nWhile most Fed policymakers agree that rates should rise and inflation should stay low, a handful of other federal policymakers, including Larry Summers, have made their case for lowering rates.\n\nSince the Fed started the process of raising rates at the beginning of October 2009, interest income increased nearly 10% in November after Bernanke issued its welcome notes. Interest income actually started falling off by around 20% last month. The Fed has since had to raise its monetary policy rate to zero to avoid a default. But the Fed did stop short of lowering the real estate market rate at least partially by a full percentage point, because many investors had been anticipating that the housing market would rise again. And, as noted earlier, it has now had to hike interest rates a couple of times since October 2009 because of rising commodity prices.\n\nThe government has also taken steps to prevent inflation from happening, since the government didn't hold interest rates at the pump in 2008. Since then, the Fed has reduced interest rates on paper by a large amount. With a small stimulus package (with an easing of the U.S. federal budget deficit) and strong job-creation measures for consumers, the goal should only have stayed very low (1% or more). However, with the economy continuing to expand, the Fed isn't quite sure what percentage of Fed officials will say that the public is \"overburdened\" with a low interest rate.\n\nMeanwhile, as we've illustrated in our recent article, the Fed is trying to keep the economy running. By raising rates after September, it is doing its job of helping to restore demand. But the public's view of the Fed is much less supportive of the Fed's role in keeping inflation from going up than it was in the first half of 2010.\n\nSince the economic data started to show that interest income and inflation had been steadily rising, we can now see that the public doesn't really understand what really happened in the housing market when the housing market was relatively flat. This might be the main cause of the high-rate housing market: the Federal Reserve has been holding interest rates on paper for so long that it doesn't give credit to a \"surpluses\" in real estate, such as home prices or the stock price of new real buildings. At the very least, the official view is that a high number of home buyers started to sell, which made up the bulk of the housing inventory.\n\nNow, the official view has got to change: if the unemployment rate is higher than it's been in months since the last report by Job & Cost, we will see a sharp slowdown in the job growth and a real downturn in the housing industry, so as to allow more stimulus and monetary policy. More importantly, we will see a higher number of people getting stuck in a bad job, which is part of the reason these reports are mostly about housing.\n\nThis is why some critics of quantitative easing and other policies to stimulate growth have been pushing for further quantitative easing at this point. It's easy to understand why. The Fed should stimulate it, not depress it. Yet in the recent comments made by the Fed official in March, he said that the Federal Funds rate should remain low \"in case the jobless rate rises.\"\n\nWhy is this? Well, the official is not claiming that growth will recover. Quite the contrary: by raising the Federal Funds rate of the same rate as the GDP growth rate, he claims that a recovery in the unemployment rate is possible. That's not quite true.

{"id": 250104, "text": "\nBy Paul Kitz\n\nThe world of gaming has changed very fast, and not by a huge margin, but by much slower than we thought. For people who want a game that's as good as it can possibly be without having to sit around and see what the other guys are doing, you need to take a look across the board. Games in development are often about getting new people involved, a lot of which is happening on the whole game. The first big thing is to build good communities (more on that in a bit) and create the kind of environments that will allow the game, and you also need to build a strong story and characters \u2013 you need to really push those boundaries and keep everyone honest and be creative when you're running a game. It's a small world where we can see things happening (the game industry was not very well organised in the 1990s) and if you make someone believe in what you're doing and if your community is great they'll join you, you're on your way.\n\nOne of the biggest challenge gamers have is getting people to actually play the games they want to play. In most of the games we've written about here at GDC \u2013 which is why the PC has dominated the market over the last decade \u2013 this is the time where it took the biggest hurdle to get people to actually play the games you want to play.\n\nThe next issue is to make sure that people who play a game at home actually play it. Games that are made at home are great for teaching, and we believe that's where there are the things we should focus on: education, development, quality of products, etc. In games where there's a huge difference in skill level, in gaming where skills are still a big issue, the best way to teach them is through games at home. The game industry doesn't play that game. It's the next best kind of game. That means making sure that your game's really challenging for your family, your friends, even a partner, to play, and you'll be learning something from it.\n\nThe next challenge that has to be done is to build our community. I think people who have seen a game at school play have been surprised at how much effort this works. Everyone knows that if you have a good game you play every day, even if no one's going to play it, that is so hard, to say the least. I personally believe that if people see something that doesn't work well, or that they feel like it's not playing well, then that's great, but they're right and if people don't like something, then that's fine. If someone likes something that doesn't work, then please make it the focus of their game. If it doesn't work for them, then go the other way. If it does work but it doesn't appeal to them, then go to the other person's game in the hope that you might be able to help them out or even help to make progress and make them play better without actually having to play any of their games or getting them feedback from strangers on their phones. That's the whole purpose of a game-playing community, really.\n\nIn fact, one of the most important aspects of playing games is the interaction with other people. You need that feeling when people ask you to play something that doesn't work and what feels wrong. People want to know what they have to change, sometimes that means changing things at will. If you're trying to make something that works it's going to be impossible because your friends know it's never going to work for them, but if you don't help them understand, then you're missing out.\n\nThe final challenge is figuring out how we can make our community as engaging and engaging as possible. We need to find a place to talk to other people about the same things that people are doing. People are interested in learning. People are interested in getting into the game industry. We are building a community and getting people to interact directly. There's no single answer here; we're looking to make the internet what it is, and to make it interesting and interesting. We're hoping for a more open and welcoming user experience, which won't make for some great games but that's not the only answer. We're already working on the best way to go about it, but it'll take a little while so that, from the get go, it's clear that we would like to be a part of it. We'll also want to let people know what we're doing here to help make the internet a better place. We're a great game company and we're here to help make it happen. We want our people to have the opportunity to learn from us, get to know us through game companies, and play with other people.\n\nI've already said that the biggest reason that the internet and other areas of our industry are so successful is because our players have been able to play games where you could play a game that works with their devices", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 250108, "text": "This is where it gets interesting. So-called \"fake news\" has become increasingly prominent in the news media, and these \"news\" stories are often based on unsubstantiated or unsubstantiated claims about the government. This is why we are often called \"fake news.\"\n\nIn September 2015, President Obama announced that he had sent a letter to Congress and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, a former aide to the president, requesting that the Department of Homeland Security report on potential terrorist attacks by foreign nationals who are not authorized to report on classified US activities on their own, to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAccording to this letter, Homeland Security officials would find that many of the foreign-born American citizens identified in this letter had their first or second name change every other month, but did not disclose such changes, nor did they reveal their nationality. This letter has resulted in many people being called back into the US at the behest of American officials. When a foreign national receives their first letter without their first name change, this letter is considered \"fake news\" for purposes of determining how far the administration will allow foreigners within the US to gain access into the United States. The FBI is concerned that the lack of transparency or accountability around this issue could cause other potential terrorists the FBI may target and even take their life, including that of a US citizen. These examples clearly indicate that the Obama Administration has deliberately targeted some foreign nationals for targeted killings, with no specific purpose.\n\nThe fact that these events are happening at all suggests that the administration may simply want to have them and the potential terrorists back into the country before further harm can occur.\n\nThere are also a number of other potential \"fake news\" stories coming from the government and organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the Council on Foreign Relations that also have their own sources that also include reports of potential foreign nationals killed in US attacks or who have their first or second names change constantly to reflect some change in their American identity.\n\nA 2015 New York Times article cited a report from the Human Rights Campaign and others that concluded that the U.S. and Israel were the two leading offenders in the deaths of Americans at the hands of terrorist acts.\n\nThe New York Times reported:\n\nThe United States has committed more than twice as many crimes as the total number of human rights violations carried out by Israel with its soldiers in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem during the six-month period from 2009 to 2014, the report found \u2013 the deadliest six-month period in world history. \"There is no evidence that Hamas, al-Nusra or other armed rebel groups, which have been designated as state sponsors of terrorism by the U.S., have carried out any crime against America's security,\" Mark Steinberg, the report's director in the U.S. and Israel, wrote.\n\nIt is also worth noting that not only has the Obama administration attempted to force Congress to authorize the use of military force against these \"fake news\" stories, it has made it difficult for them to report those stories to lawmakers. In October 2011, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson issued a directive to American officials that made it difficult for them to report stories about a particular US citizen by their name, without their first and second names changing. This \"fake news\" directive essentially says that if a foreign citizen with their first name change does not report a story about the attack that would be reported and would cause the Department of Homeland Security to make more drastic recommendations including creating a more active Secretaries of Homeland Security that can \"evaluate and consider ways to make an issue more visible or difficult to report,\" that the President can use the new Department of Homeland Security to force congressional action without having to notify the public that a story has already been reported.\n\nWhat is the real problem here? Not only is that the U.S. State Department is a known sponsor and promoter of terroristic propaganda that makes it extremely hard for Americans to make informed and transparent public disclosure of their government's activities in the coming year.\n\nOne recent event that could have brought this problem to its attention and cause an immediate outcry was the 2014 incident at an anti-Israel rally on the East Jerusalem Bridge. The event was sponsored by the Jewish Coalition for Peace, whose executive director and executive vice president of communications, Adam Jentleson, and his father, Peter Jentleson, are supporters of Hamas and also the former head of Israel's largest Hamas-affiliated group the Hamas Fatah movement.\n\nThe fact that the Palestinian Authority has used its authority over the East Jerusalem bridge as an opportunity to declare a state of emergency has caused a great deal of outrage. In fact, the fact that several of the \"foreign agents\" who were responsible for the event are now back in the US and are now involved in a lawsuit against the Obama Administration is further indication of how extremely biased these authorities are.\n\nNow that we see the Obama Administration's intent to push for the U", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

There was the island with the oldest city, which is only about 7,400 miles away from the Dominican Republic, and the second, most populous county in North America.\n\nThe island, also known as Santa Cruz, consists of just over 1 million people. It's located on the southern coast of Puerto Rico, which makes it less populous. The two islands are connected by a network of three inland waterways, one at the north, one at the south (called the Palos Verdes Peninsula), and this area is dotted with beaches and canals.\n\nI can't stress enough how important the Palos Verdes Peninsula is, and how close we were to discovering what a true map is, but in the past months, I've looked on the peninsula in a more intimate way.\n\nThe Palos Verdes Peninsula is a major tourist destination, especially when the region is connected by the South American country of Uruguay, which I've never seen before.\n\nThe North is part of the National Park System, an area of 4 million people located off the coast of Palos Verdes and south of Santa Cruz.\n\nTo get there, you need to travel along the South coast along Interstate 35, which is just 1 to 2 miles long. From the south, a trail crosses northbound freeway in the Central Business River and west to the area where the Palos Verdes Peninsula ends off north. While you don't need a car or a GPS, this section of highway takes less than 15 minutes.\n\nThe route is very scenic, as at the end of a long stretch of highway on the south, you'll turn directly south to get from the National Park system to the Palos Verdes Peninsula, but you've gotta get there for it. Once you get to Santa Cruz, the road just turns south.\n\nIf you're planning on heading north for the Palos Verdes, be sure to stop by my hotel, at the end of the peninsula, as the tour will take roughly a minute.\n\nIt's probably best when taking a tour with friends or family, or if you're an adventurous person, to take a boat to the beach. However, when you're going about traveling with family, or traveling to Puerto Rico, make sure you check out my book and take a flight.\n\nWe arrived in Puerto Rico on a Friday evening in 2011, and it took us a few days from the town of Santa Rosa to the small coastal town of La Palma, about 20 miles upstream of the Spanish border.\n\nWe met people, went fishing and stopped in a caf\u00e9 to find out what life was like for people like me, and how to learn Spanish. For three reasons: to understand the language, to live a life with family and friends that are here in Puerto Rico, and to get to know each other.\n\nWe were at a caf\u00e9 called Keto. The place didn't really have much to offer in the way of French, but I tried it! Most people here have the Spanish equivalent of a dictionary, so it was a little daunting to figure out some of the basics, and a place where even if you have to do a little math to get an answer, you already know what it is. However, the place is great for learning Spanish, and I feel like at La Palma, it was a safe space where we would have done a lot of walking outside, and could sit at the bar, learn, and enjoy our coffee and French.\n\nThis was the beginning of my first trip to Puerto Rico, and I love it there. I was always told that it was more than just a few weeks, but I've made all of my friends here, and it's been a lot of fun, and you really get to know each other that much better now.\n\nThe restaurant on our way in was known as El Tama\u00f1o.

You could definitely tell the atmosphere was pretty bad, especially given the amount of people that had their drink glasses scattered about in the tables. There were several girls who were eating here and they were talking about their girlfriends.\n\nThe place is usually packed, but it's easy to find people in Spanish. I guess what I loved most about this place is that it has an all-time favorite restaurant from the 1950s on tap, which reminded me of my favorite thing about this place in New York: people who have lived in New York for some time.\n\nThe first time I visited Puerto Rico, I was the only person in", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

Well, since this is just another round of speculation I suppose we'll just have to go with her own suggestions.\n\nHere's how to do it:\n\nPick a good random character\n\nNow, in the past several years we've seen some wonderful examples of characters that seemed to be good but were actually rather bland or just barely decent. It was the case against Sigmund Freud and his \"fairy tales\" that would be more surprising if they were so strong and had no purpose. What I liked most about Sigmund Freud was what he said about characters like his own who just lack a purpose or need to be helped. He was very blunt about his personal tastes in characters like Sigmund, and often used that to explain his ideas about why he disliked certain types of characters.\n\nHere are a couple of examples of how to do it:\n\nPick a good random character with good personality and personality traits\n\nI'm going to get back to this at the end of the article. I'll mention something else I've talked about that's worth pointing out here:\n\nPick a single character or class when there are many people\n\nA good character with strong personality or personality traits does have its own distinctive personality trait so he or she may or may not have some kind of unique personality trait to tie to its character. To get good at that particular character, you always want to have somebody with strong character traits of your own or a well-rounded personality. This is especially important the more you see them as being different or different from other characters or even better.\n\nBut for our purposes here, here are a few things to consider as a rule:\n\nCharacter Type: How often are you going to get into this character?\n\nWhat's your background?\n\nWhat is your role model?\n\nWhat kind of character is your \"good guy\"?\n\nIs this a good choice?\n\nIf this is your only choice and you're looking to be great as a character, you'll want to pick a character whose character traits speak for themselves. So the best way to find out is to try the following choices.\n\nChoose a character you think will work best for you.\n\nI don't recommend making these choice unless I feel something like this will make you happy because you're going to make friends of your own or you want to feel like you have some kind of special connection with something you really are.\n\nPick a character that you think you'll like and want to work for.\n\nDo you dislike having a particular type of character or is that part of your personality too strong?\n\nIn addition to this, pick a character that you find interesting. For example I've said before that I like Sigmund. I wouldn't recommend having the likes of his character be bad, because of his poor character traits. Sigmund had a big impact on me because I was really stuck in my ways that he didn't fully understand. So pick a character that I think you're going to enjoy.", "length": 680, "ended": true}

It was kind of like when I was 10, just getting to the first Disney World movie: \"Whoa, I'm so bad at that and I can't do it. I'm so bad at that.\" But then when I was 13, I was in Disneyland. We had a lot of fun at Disneyland that year, so when I came back, I had never done it before. We were so happy. There are so many great Disney park scenes nowadays that we've never seen before, so we never saw them. It was a real, long ride.\n\nR.O.B.: It's been a real journey on your journey to get in the movies you love, but what do you wish you had known before you did? Would it have been different if you had been a better filmmaker at the time?\n\nP.S.: I don't think getting on a plane or taking a tour was really important, and I know that I was lucky that my family was there.

This is what I want to be here for my life.\"\n\nR.O.B.: Are you glad that you were there?\n\nP.S.: Yes it was.

People are saying, 'Well, let's get more people involved. I want to make sure that our police have the necessary resources,'\" he added, then added: \"If the criminal justice system has not gone, they're going to continue to get more murders and violent crimes.\"\n\nWhile the U.K., Germany, the U.S., and Germany continue to take steps toward improving their own criminal justice systems, the U.S. and Canada haven't, and so far, they're having little effect. In addition, they're only \"reversing\" some of the country's laws, and a handful of laws could help, including a slew of new gun control measures.\n\nStill, as the President has told President Obama in recent weeks, they don't look like \"normal\" people's problem. We see \"an epidemic of gun control\" everywhere, he said. And in New Jersey, his recent comments are not the first time that things have gotten so bad that people believe that a certain person is the cause. There have been reports in the press that cops are often forced out of a home, even when their security is up to the task. And for good measure, there have been reports of a national conversation about crime and incarceration as well. In an article in the New York Times, Jonathan Chait and Michael Isikoff, two Princeton researchers on crime and incarceration, explored this idea and suggested that it might be a better use of government's resources than a lot of the crime that's happening right now. It's important to note that Chait and Isikoff note in their article that the national debate over gun control is much ado about nothing, but rather \"a very interesting and ongoing trend about the extent to which a person is the actual cause of crime: on one hand, people are concerned by what they see as their inability to prevent or mitigate incidents like the recent shooting in Chicago, and on the other hand, people who engage in criminal pursuits in an attempt to protect their own lives get turned away; in one-sided situations, however, there seem to be some people who are actually motivated to act upon something \u2014 even if the cause of the problem is simply their own personal desire.\" And in a recent article on his blog, The New York Times criticizes a group of New Jerseyers, citing their lack of real crime prevention education and policing skills.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nAt a press conference in Philadelphia, one young man told reporters that he came to the defense of a couple of his older lovers during a fight in his apartment and his cousin's car on Thursday night. \"My cousins were involved in a fight \u2014 a couple of older guys, one guy and one guy, with their cousins,\" he recounted. We can see from the photos that, of course, he was one of them, as did this reporter. \"I knew that these were good guys, but I don't know what they did to them,\" he told the reporter.\n\nBut perhaps the greatest lesson that can be drawn from the recent events is that the people of New Jersey are all too aware of what might be happening, and just want to stop it, regardless of the merits of things like gun control. Many still believe they should use their authority as citizens to do nothing about it, and that this fear should be rooted in ignorance. But at the same time, even if an individual takes up arms, they've got a responsibility to do so, a responsibility to look at what people could do to help if something were to happen to them. And perhaps we're not quite there yet, yet.\n\nThere's a big problem for politicians to understand. While it's true that they're not in good position to try and stop gun ownership, we know that the problems they're solving are getting bigger: in 2009, the FBI identified 3.8 million people killed by firearms at home \u2014 more than", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

But why did the game so hard to sell so quickly, and where did it come from? Was it just a coincidence that you both had a computer in their living room, and you were playing a video game called Counter-Strike in a car?\n\nSo, as a guy with no Internet at all, you've spent the last couple of months trying to figure out which game genre to buy: Dota 2. You've already spent a few minutes doing the same, and a few minutes getting into the habit.

We had friends who were in college at college. We had our friend who was working in a startup. And when we started, they were all doing the same game. We didn't know each other. But by playing Counter-Strike for a quarter of a decade, we had established that our team would win every game we started without a glitch. We had gotten a lot of money from players like us, but we had never gotten to get to the point where we could use it to compete every single game out there.\n\nBut it turned out a few years before that when we decided we would stop playing, because it didn't make sense for our friends to start playing other games like our favorite. We decided to do this for a few years. We never played competitive games. We just watched other people play Dota 2, and even more so, with friends who had played other popular games that didn't take their turn. They had never played them before against a real competitor, but in this game, you play against other real people, and they'll never play against the same team. We thought that would be an acceptable way to get into the game, because our game never really ended. Maybe at some point this wasn't a good idea for anyone who wanted to play any games.\n\nWe decided that if we could improve on people's games for the rest of their careers, it wouldn't do any good for us.

It was fun to play on the back end of a computer all day.\n\nIf you're an aspiring game developer \u2014 an actual game manager or engineer, for that matter \u2014 you might want to read the full story of how the game played out in your home.

Or maybe you need to keep learning, trying new things, doing what you love for a long time.\n\nThis doesn't mean that you necessarily need to do everything right this way when you try any other game.

{"id": 250121, "text": ".\n\nIt was not long before his father was brought into the fold, and he, too, was put through every stage of his development.\n\nHis father's ability in the field (he was an all-rounder in high school), and also in the business of football and other business, was not in doubt. It was not simply a matter of his education. What was really needed was his training of his mind, which he had to do through all those decades when he was simply a poor kid. But to become a footballer, to go on to be in such a great position as to become a manager (not just any manager), he found himself without an understanding of everything that made him so highly qualified. His father, in this case, was a specialist about football, and in his ability to manage that, made his career. On that basis he was asked to come and try to help.\n\nThat came in handy when one day in an interview with his father, his uncle, in December 1982. The former head coach told the assembled reporters that his grandfather had been a successful businessman (he got up at 6:30 in the morning and worked 12-0), and that his father was \"very strong\", but also said he was \"probably not good enough\" to try and help develop the team. He then gave the interviewer more information, but the interviewer was, of course, told in all seriousness that he was going nowhere right now; this was a mistake. He did not know what was going on, how much money was being taken and when, so that was more important than making sure he put everything in order. And he was clearly disappointed by the way the interview, the interviewer's questions and the way that, in a very short period of time, he got that information.\n\nThe problem was, with his father, he did not have an understanding of everything that went on behind the scenes.\n\nIn fact, the problem didn't even arise in a very short space of time. In December 1982 he was placed into special training at the age of 19. That same year he won an international player of the year award at the UEFA Under-17 Championships, and was subsequently selected for his national team squad that travelled to Brazil for the World Cup 2014. He made it to the last 16 of their team before being given the opportunity to play for Argentina.\n\nAll this was because of his grandfather, who was not only an intelligent man but one who had grown up in a very rich family. But it all came together to lead his family to an extremely rich future.\n\nBut why? Did this not happen in a time when, having achieved so much in so short a time, the world was getting ready for what it would become on January 28, 2015?\n\nIt is well-known that the \"good old days\" of footballing were short, when the \"good old days\" were all about finding talent (not necessarily just a new breed, at least in English football)\u2014but the time was right to put the best in their eyes, particularly that, when they saw such success stories come to life on such a day, it didn't feel like life in many football clubs were in a hurry. At Tottenham Hotspur, it was about how big his team was in the second tier and the importance of the players to the team at the time, not just their individual ability but the overall impact they had.\n\nThe way players were placed on the pitch, such as on the wing, was very important. A lot of these players were not available to the team on the outside, and if they went to the ground that night to face opponents who were all looking to take care of something else, as they did, the results would immediately be disastrous.\n\nOn the other hand, there were certain players, like Bale and Sergio Ag\u00fcero, who were not available on the front and didn't need to be so important to have any effect on the team. But he had come back from injury and, in a short spell at the club, this team had become very good at what it did and they had won that European Cup. He had gone to Spurs when he was injured and started in the final, and it was only when he was not in there for that injury that he started to play. In a way he was still more of a problem than he used to be.\n\nHowever, it did not change what has happened with Bale as well. Because he went back to the English game, he became a more important player. The problems with the national team in that time were not just for him, but for other players. He did not need to make a big step up for a club like Tottenham Hotspur before becoming involved. It also took his time, a little longer for him to get back into the team. It was never his fault, but the fact that he had been injured a few months earlier and was still struggling, and was at an early age, changed things quite drastically", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

She had her own issues and she loved working with me but she never asked me to \"fix\" her feelings.\n\nI was so devastated by this tragedy because of the impact my life has had on other people all around me. My husband, our two daughters, and I had a hard time trusting ourselves enough to try to make it through. I'm sure that many of you on this blog, and others you may encounter, will relate to their loss.\n\nI know that people in the community often feel that their children are alone and that they may feel isolated and ashamed of doing what they do as a result. And even though they don't like it, the way they do things can go awry. This is a common sense issue with children.\n\nI would like all my readers to know that I never have felt in any way a little bit like my husband or even more than my wife is. Our relationship has been a struggle since we both graduated college, and I know many families who have gone through some great things or had great experiences. But when I had to go through the pain, I just wanted to do it for her and keep going and keep working to make it better.\n\nI think you have experienced this a lot but you may not have always experienced as much. My experience was that you never learned how to be an addict or how to overcome feelings. You might not have learned how to deal with other people's problems, but you had been doing everything you could get your hands on just to get through things better and feel okay.\n\nMy experience is not always the same. I mean, I was a little depressed at first, but it's also been a little more positive. You didn't realize how much I loved you until you left my life and you were just my son. I didn't realize what sort of person you were until we got into college with your school principal. It was so much better.\n\nAfter college my life changed, and our daughter was just 6 years old. My husband and I went back to the States and got married. We got divorced. My children grew up with us and we spent most of our time with them.\n\nI always felt like our family and friends were just too fragile. This world was a difficult place to have kids. I can't remember in my life when I was a child when I was told that it's a bad idea to have three kids when you have a lot of your own kids.\n\nIn retrospect, I hope that we might realize why our kids were important to us and we wouldn't have allowed ourselves to turn that fact into a distraction or a problem. It's a really, really complicated part of having your own kids. You can't take away your own children or your friends and make them suffer because of how good they are or just how easy it is.\n\nI hope my story is just some of the more common experiences that young people will face. And if you know one or two of my children or you are reading this and feel uncomfortable sharing stories that were the best you could and would have been better off not sharing, please do let me know you have them in your prayers for each one of them.\n\nLet's Love\n\n(I do wish we could continue to talk about parenting but I hope that you will understand that it's hard, sometimes hard. We all do our best for those closest to us, but let a person be so close that they become numb to their own pain or a person feels guilty or angry or just a person who they should let go of.

{"id": 250128, "text": "I have always considered myself a professional poker player and a game maven. I have played many online poker games and I have made up a few tournaments. I have also been in a few tournaments and have made several tournaments that require time for learning a new method. I did have a lot of experience playing poker but I never really understood how well I would be able to play poker unless I were a top 9 player in any of the online tournaments. If you think I was a bad player, if you think I was a good player, or if you think I was mediocre, no matter what you think, just stop and think about it. Go through some of the online games that you just play. This helps you gain a feeling of what you are doing.\n\nA good poker player comes from the basics of a skill \u2013 knowledge of your hand movements. For this reason, you must not always play your cards the same way you played poker. You may not have a clear idea of your hand movements, but if you play your cards correctly, what you see, and what you do is what you should try to tell your opponent. I used to think that there were rules for playing poker. That game was like chess. You had a \"win/lose\" strategy. Each move you made was followed by many chances. When each game was won or lost, you would play your best moves. When your opponent started winning, you would play your worst and give up. What the game was like? When you were the only player allowed to win, you were \"winning\" by playing your best moves. If you did not think like that, then that is why. A good poker player is not a good player playing bad moves. You will learn from your opponent's mistakes and make mistakes and that is why you win. However, you should not assume that your play is flawless, because you are just trying to learn a new position and it is not going to work as an exact match. If you are playing bad moves, you may win because you know what your opponent will do. That is the only way to win poker. The skill set of poker players has never been the same as the skills of pros or amateur players. When you find the correct way to play your cards to the last possible moment in between your best moves, that is the skill set for your game.\n\nYou will be an excellent player, as well. You might be able to have another great game and be like an NBA player and then play in the NFL as well. If you want to be an absolute top player, you have to play very well for poker. And that is all that you want to see. But if you don't know the rules to play your best moves with respect, then you may not think like a professional poker player. Go out and play at least some of the local games that you will play for the first time as well. Get in the habit of having your poker in your pocket and do your best to win.\n\nPoker for poker players for sure is never about luck or luck at all. It is about skill. It is about putting those skills into practice and learning the skills of poker players from the most successful pro poker players the world has ever seen.\n\nI have been a professional poker player since I was 6 years old. I have played most of the online games and tournament games since I was 15. From my very first tournament and second. I always used to have a few ideas about the game that I would try and get me ready for, but then I knew that the game wasn't in my game. I didn't have a good understanding of poker. I would try to find out the rules and play around with what I knew \u2013 so that I learned how to play without playing out a lot. As I grew up I was able to see the poker game as a game of skill. I knew that this time, I could play, and try to have a good game against my opponents. I think I knew something that made me a better player.\n\nAs the years went by when I became a big pro gamer, I got better at my poker game. After a while I knew I needed to learn the game better. I also got better at playing with my son and father who I could bring to play the game. I also realized that it is important to learn how to play the game when you are in the middle of the game. I would play in a lot of different ways, playing against different players and making mistakes. I realized that it is not the perfect game \u2013 but I figured that I was a good poker player. So after a while I decided that it would be too difficult to become a professional poker player. So I started to develop a lot of skills in poker. I also started getting bigger poker tournament games I already had. I started finding better tournaments. Before I was a professional player, I had no idea of a professional game that I could play and it wasn't until a couple of years", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 250133, "text": "\nAt the centre of this issue of anti-Muslim hostility \u2014 from the first days of the Muslim revolution to the present \u2014 there is a debate on whether Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance rather than a racist force.\n\nThe radical right, in particular Islamic fundamentalists such as Mr Johnson and Mr Cameron, believe the religion of peace and tolerance should be the focus of the EU's national security budget, a position which, at present, it accepts at best as a denial, with some critics of the proposed cuts describing it as a pretext to \"cut inwards to the extent that we cut into the resources of the European Union's national security services.\"\n\nBut one former member for the Royal College of Exeter, Sir Michael Waugh, who teaches political economy at Birmingham City University and has spent many years in political journalism, agrees that the new fiscal plans don't address what critics call a fundamental flaw.\n\nInstead they do so by increasing taxes on Islam, including by an estimated \u00a32.3bn a year for the NHS, by cutting the amount required for religious institutions to be considered an independent entity \u2014 which is \"a very bad thing, but it's not that bad!\" \u2014 and by cutting the number of mosques the government must open.\n\nAnd since the last election, this has become a central theme.\n\nMr Cameron has described the NHS as \"the most controversial organisation in the country\" and has tried hard to explain away an increase in fees if he doesn't persuade Conservative MPs that he is \"supporting Muslim and gay people who want to live in freedom\". But Dr Waugh says he is far more concerned about increasing the number and number of refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran and Iraq.\n\nThe EU budget may prove a big stumbling block for these anti-extremist proposals. This may come with risks. And perhaps there is some sympathy for Muslim extremists on the part of some Eurosceptics for those who hold them. But, at the same time, the issue is not simply a Tory issue.\n\nWhen people in London voted overwhelmingly for Theresa May's May's election campaign but were sceptical how many Muslims they would get into the EU, they were told that it was their duty as Muslims not to vote. This has not stopped the Muslim community in the north from expressing a similar concerns.\n\nIn London's north, Muslim immigrants are more likely to have faith than are European immigrants. When a Muslim council is closed to Christian or Muslim faith groups, they tend to stay in the south.\n\nThe problem is that those who say they want to live in freedom and equal rights are not taking them seriously, but rather are simply being asked to do so by an anti-Muslim right which, for various reasons, sees Islam as something that should be abolished or even stopped. This leads to a real divide with Londoners.\n\nThere is a view from some in the community that Muslims should have less say in the Brexit negotiations (the \"right to stay\" was once banned) and therefore should be treated as \"second class citizens\" even if Muslim-related concerns are not addressed in the Brexit negotiations. The British Muslim Council also believes this \"may well lead to some serious problems\" but insists it will only lead to a backlash against those who support them.\n\nAs for Brussels, the French are also more conservative than Londoners, and say that the EU must be \"as fair as possible\" when it comes to EU issues. But this is not true of the British and German Muslims.\n\nIn the UK, there is an obvious tension with the Muslim vote: a quarter of those asked to say \"no\" for the UK government's Brexit deal said there was \"very little difference\", as measured by the survey of British and German Muslims. In May's general election, 44 per cent of Muslim voters said there was no difference, the same as before the vote. A similar number were asked about plans to cut immigration.\n\nThe problem is that some Muslim groups and Muslims say there are no such issues with Brexit. In Britain, this can be seen because the Conservative's government supports a Muslim ban that puts Britain in contravention of Article 50, the UK's commitment to a free and open Europe.\n\nBut the problem is even worse for Britain's far left. Many of the far-left Labour MPs who endorsed Mr Cameron \u2014 and who have come out in favour of a referendum on Britain's EU membership \u2014 say that the Labour policy should be limited to tackling immigration but will not be affected by Britain leaving the rest of the EU.\n\nThe real question is whether a Muslim vote to leave the EU can be \"prejudiced\" \u2014 with Labour and the far left opposing it, for example \u2014 and thus the real problem with anti-extremism legislation is just if not whether this is actually necessary.\n\nIn Britain for the long haul, we are not alone among many who say the government should give way to pro-extremism legislation (at least for the foreseeable future", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

The speaker, a young man named David, was talking about how he, his parents and his colleagues are getting ahead with their plans for the next generation in the company's long-term plans to be the first people in the world who haven't had a workplace experience for at least a decade. He asked me about his dream of being an architect, one whose future is \"a world-first that will change the way we think about work and relationships.\"\n\nThis was a very personal experience, and it was the first time someone I know knew me had that sort of question in their mind.\n\n\"David,\" I called, \"that's a good question.\"\n\nHe said something that made me start laughing with laughter, because it felt like I had heard him a lot: \"Maybe someday I'll get to be an architect.\"\n\nI had a lot of fun with this question, and eventually I realized that the answer wasn't necessarily obvious. After all, he said, architects are \"all you need to know, and you'll eventually be an architect.\" It made me cringe, but I still don't think it sounds funny.\n\nHe's right \u2014 building without a workplace means that you're at risk from being taken out. I was right to pause and think about this: you're going to be a much better architect.\n\nHow did the other people in attendance react? They were delighted with how I handled it. A few of them seemed to enjoy it. Others were very happy. Some made me think that I may have to quit my job or go to college. Others didn't. The reason they all did is because they thought I was doing a really good job and wanted somebody who could work with other people who weren't good at their jobs.\n\nSo the reason I had to exit my job was because the company that offered me one really nice education was offering me one of the most advanced college degrees at zero cost.

You cannot be in Syria' and in our country we have one state. So you can only be in war in one state. We have one revolution, we have more than one city; we have hundreds of villages.\n\nBut I do not see that as the problem of Syria, of the situation in Syria. Let me just stress what I think is the real problem with Syria. Some people say that the issue of Assad is only there because Assad is in power; then if we take the Syrian problem over with the rebels and start the war in an open war, then we will see the war continue in another country that is less prone to terrorism, that is the United States of America as well.\n\nIn this situation, the first priority is to bring an end to the violence in Syria and to remove all the terrorists. That is their main aim. That's their main goal. So we are doing everything possible to bring the situation to a legal and peaceful resolution.\n\nYou have a lot of countries, including Iran and North Korea, with whom you have a deal on how to bring an end to the conflict. You are negotiating with the Iran-backed Syrian National Council that is a good partner for Syria right now. As for the other countries in the region as well, it doesn't appear to be a great arrangement. That is a problem which is to be brought in. How are you preparing it?\n\nFAM: We are preparing a new project of a ceasefire that will end the bloodshed in Syria. As I said in my talk, this is not a negotiation and it does not go to war. It is the Syrian state itself and the people, that are part of the problem.\n\nBut the first priority is to bring an end to the violent events of the past few days. We can only do that once the situation is cleared. We cannot start an armed conflict and have to get rid of the terrorists. So as of now that project, we cannot start an armed conflict.\n\nThis plan is a very good idea, but we cannot have peace without peace because of the terrorists. We are not a democratic country, and this problem is not a democratic problem.\n\nThe current situation is such an issue that people are not in a democratic country anymore, because they have not had a lot of experience. I will say that as a human rights researcher, I know that the situation is still unstable and that, at long last, people will not take action. But as long as they continue to take action, this is the moment in which the situation starts to change.\n\nThe Syrian people have an enormous power that is in control of the situation, whether", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

FGM aircraft can only fly in air-to-air combat operations, and do not have to fly the F-16 on any sortie. The fighter and the bomber operate as separate aircraft, and have a greater air control role within a fighter. FGM aircraft can fly both for combat and air traffic, and carry heavier munitions. Air traffic control of both aircraft has to be done under a high level of clearance, a common problem on an aircraft in the air for air traffic control and other tasks. FGM pilots also carry the heaviest possible weapons, and carry large quantities of ammunition. Both aircraft use a larger, straighter engine, heavier wing, and have more powerful engines. The engine of each type has its own weight limit, the greater the number of turbopumps, the lighter the fuel and the higher the warhead in the engine. This means that, depending upon the pilot and aircraft position, the engine size may vary greatly from one aircraft to the next, but each aircraft will have different requirements for their airworthiness.\n\nFGM aircraft are more powerful compared to planes flown directly by human pilots. When these aircraft are flown in air-to-air combat operations, you must not only know the requirements of a F-16 airplane, but you should also know the requirements of an F-35 program airplane. You may have to fly all three or 4 aircraft simultaneously, but flying all these two aircraft will not have the same airworthy capabilities.

The agency is also working to develop tools for monitoring and collecting data by the American government.\n\nThe Guardian first reported on NSA and Google's plans to gather metadata on millions of Australians in 2010, after the revelations of massive data abuse between 2010 and 2015 by the Chinese government and Google.\n\nIn October 2015, the Guardian revealed surveillance operations in the US and Canadian governments using a trove of electronic data. \"The NSA has no control over internet user data at all, but the collection of data about Internet behaviour is now under way and would help law enforcement, and especially law enforcement for criminal investigators,\" a document obtained by the Guardian states.\n\nThe US government recently revealed that it has been collecting metadata for the surveillance of foreign internet sites owned by internet giants such as Facebook and Google.\n\nThe Guardian also reported a similar programme involving the US National Security Agency that began in October 2016. Although the agency has not revealed who it collected that data, it has been reported that it collected data from Yahoo, email addresses, and phone numbers.\n\nThe Guardian also reported a program it described as a \"surveillance operation\" for Britain, following a US court's decision in July to allow the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to obtain a warrant for a UK firm used to monitor the communications of Americans. The agency, which is overseen by former Secretary of State William Binney, also obtained a search warrant for Verizon Communications and the internet company AT&T.\n\nThe news article noted that it is already common for large internet companies to use US agencies for bulk access.\n\n\"These requests for bulk data \u2013 particularly over phone numbers and email addresses \u2013 are a practice that has been going on for years, but a major exception is 'domestic' data collected by the military, police, and other civil service agencies that was passed on to us by our foreign counterparts. So, as our domestic agencies collect information from people overseas, we are able to track them. It's not just the information you get from a website, but the information you can receive via email or video.\n\n\"In 2010, for example, the NSA collected records for the telephone number, place of residence, and phone service, and its records for social media, the e-mails, and Facebook interactions. This year's collection has been the subject of a number of investigations and court decisions, so I think we are going to have a much more detailed look at this in terms of the metadata, particularly as it relates to internet activity through the internet,\" said Jonathan Beazley, an attorney at the Centre for Computer Tools and Technology who conducted a legal analysis of the new technology.\n\nThe Guardian report was not the first time surveillance data had been given its own due process. In 2009 and 2010, for example, the British Foreign Office gave the NSA the data it needed to carry out surveillance of suspected terrorist suspects and suspected paedophiles.\n\nOther governments have also been interested in collecting information on internet users. The UK government has already shown interest in collecting digital metadata, saying it could assist in its national security by analysing \"sensitive content\", such as social media, internet browsing history, and online activities.", "length": 673, "ended": true}

This article will provide you with some tips to help with your next budget and save your money.\n\nDon't give up when you can't keep your house\n\nIf you've ever paid taxes on your home and used it for the last ten years on your way out, that's not too surprising. We've all heard about the need to keep your house tidy - at least for a few years after your return, but also after you have finished an online job.\n\nThat's because there is always a place for some help. Many people are willing to give up a house to buy a house that does not qualify as yours, but we recommend making sure you save the money on it by providing your house with a nice place to take your children.\n\nIf you have never paid your tax once before, then you should take it time. One of the best ways is to look around and make sure you buy some clothes in the best places, such as the ones that do not cost you a penny.\n\nTake out a mortgage when it is a big debt, especially if you have a mortgage and you are working on your new house. If you find yourself in a hole for any of the time the house is gone, you can take some out to avoid paying taxes on it. The best way is renting your mortgage, but keep those things together, if you are renting them at all. Otherwise you can take advantage of a housekeeper that is paying a decent amount of taxes at the same time you are making payments.\n\nPay no more than you can afford\n\nFor some people, it's almost impossible to keep up. But if you live in a big housing market like Sydney you should do you a favour and avoid getting a mortgage. While it may seem you shouldn't pay anything on a mortgage, there are several other factors that can make it even harder and if you manage to keep up then you can start earning more on your way out.\n\nThis guide covers all of the different ways people can pay off their mortgage, from simple to complicated.\n\nThis is for some advice on making money from your money management business - just make sure that you are keeping your money for a while. We believe that everyone who starts their business should have paid enough on time for as long as possible, and that the sooner you start using the smaller part of your money you will end up with the bigger profit margins you'd like.\n\nBut, it is worth remembering that the longer you stay, the more money you'll have to use to pay off your mortgage, so if you are still not able to keep up with all the bills and taxes you have been getting for years, take an easy and economical course of action, such as making an appointment to the Bank.\n\nWhen you're done with this guide, we look forward to hearing from you.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, do share it with others by liking us on Facebook!

Please bear with us.\n\nMore ways to save money\n\nThere are many different ways to reduce your expenses while working, but at the end of the day, we want to be able to take a look at a few things so that you can make better choices when it comes to saving.\n\nFor example, we can think of savings as being in the \"money\" for the people who can afford it. Since the most efficient way is that one can cut down on the expenses of their household, this means having a great choice in savings, and helping them.\n\nIn addition, some of the ways you can help your family (or friends) is to help them take care of their debts and to make a budget that includes things such as accommodation. This helps build up a family that gets the most value out of life, or just to put a dent in its debt problems.\n\nWe also want to hear from you to see where you can invest in saving for retirement and start your own savings account (it's one of your main assets if you're in the latter half of the century).\n\nAnother great way to save a little is using a 401(k) and IRA. These savings can be pretty good if you're having trouble earning a decent living but you do enjoy the benefits too as can be seen at the image in the bottom right of the post. Just remember, it will all depend on whether you are working or not.\n\nDon't forget to ask your question!\n\nIf you're looking for a great way to learn from our top tips on saving for retirement, you could find more tips, such as the links below - just take a look!\n\nThanks for reading.

{"id": 250153, "text": "Feminists have a long history of expressing their opinion on the issue of feminism. The most vocal of these activists are feminists (and the most outspoken). Many of them even identify themselves with different social issues, such as race, sex and LGBT equality. However, there are a few misconceptions about what feminism is about.\n\nThere is a \"women's movement\" under discussion. Women's movements are a movement of women who are concerned about their own health. Men's struggles with pregnancy and birth can include gender identity as well. However, the most common misperception among feminists is that feminism takes seriously all the major problems faced by non-believers in the current day. In fact, feminist advocacy of the \"gender wage disparity\" has been an important source of economic success for many non-believers in the past and is a great source of economic wealth and education. These myths continue to be perpetuated in our society. A major flaw with the mainstream feminist approach in the past has been that it does not consider people of all sorts of different genders. People of different genders are simply not included in feminism.\n\nPeople of different races, religions, races are not included, either.\n\nGender, sexual orientation or any other characteristic is not necessarily included in feminism.\n\nPeople of different genders are sometimes not even allowed to sit around in front of a mirror to tell others their gender. This, in most instances, does not mean that it isn't true, and, in fact, it is far easier for a feminist to simply point to a picture for discussion. Feminists should only try to engage others in a productive conversation about their issues.\n\nFeminism focuses on what is important. The most important issue we care about is the health of the human person. It is this health that is the primary focus of modern feminism. As people of all different identities, our work can help people of all races, religions, cultures, and nationalities to build a better world. However, in order to achieve this end we often need people who have a certain type of sexual orientation, a certain gender identity, a certain religious affiliation, or some other type of racial or cultural origin. As we are constantly trying to address these needs for ourselves, it makes sense to make every effort to create a welcoming culture where women and men can participate in our activities and be empowered in our work.\n\nWe believe that, for all of our diverse backgrounds, there are things that we all share. Therefore, we must always be conscious of our roles in society, and try to work toward making our social, emotional and physical lives as humanly possible.\n\nWomen in Africa.\n\nFeminism can not only provide women with a place to be themselves, but all of us can be at the forefront of this process. The issue of female empowerment has been the most often discussed topic throughout the feminist movement over the past few decades and has been a key component in achieving women's equality and inclusion in our world. Men in Africa have a distinct lack of representation in the global conversation, in fact, it is almost impossible to find a single representative in that space at a given time.\n\nFeminist groups such as Women, Fight For Equality and Women's Action Africa (WAFAL) are doing a fantastic job of encouraging a positive conversation about women's rights in Africa. The movement is not the only voice which works against the patriarchal system of oppression but there are many other voices which work equally and effectively to prevent this system. We should not ignore the importance of these voices if we need to talk about what we can and can't do in Africa.\n\nWomen in other countries, especially, must stand against the male rule that is perpetuated by patriarchal societies where women are given the role of protector and not the protector of men, and against men, who rape and assault women. Women who choose to participate in the ongoing struggle for men's and women's gender equality would be most welcome.\n\nFeminism is for all men, not only people of different gender identities and sexualities.\n\nFeminism is not for women to sit around in front of a mirror, and not only women who are wearing skimpy clothes to meet their needs. FEMINIST women, even those who wear skimpy clothes, are able to express their own personal needs in our own homes and work communities by dressing appropriately and with the right care.\n\nAs much as I would like to make a specific point about people in Africa, and all of us should, we often forget this fact. The fact remains, every African woman who participates in feminism is doing so for the right reasons. We are taking the lead and putting our lives on the line with our voices. Men and women working together to promote equality, equality for all, is why many countries are experiencing the best possible women's development. We could not be better able to accomplish our mission to make that happen.\n\nFeminism can also help support women who are trying out for a career", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

It was the only other thing I understood to actually go through the hole in the map,\" he added. \"With the three geologues on board, I was able to identify exactly how they would be able to get past it and it was extremely gratifying.\"\n\nThe goal is to have a map that is a part of the geologic history that spans the entire northeastern coast of North America, the team found.\n\n\"I think we are really happy about how the maps are taking advantage of everything that happens in nature right now and that can serve as a way for us to make more of them,\" Sorensen said.\n\nThe maps will have their own \"superiority level\" to those of other geology surveys of the entire continental U.S.\n\nThe maps can take up to 1,500 pages and the team hopes they will provide valuable insights into the local story of the American Great Migration and the development of the U.S..\n\nSorensen said the map can be used to better serve as a tool to help those who are seeking out their information, as well as those who simply don't have the resources or experience to look at other locations or make an informed decision about an area.\n\nThey also hope to provide new insights to those who would otherwise be unable to find a lake to help them determine where to go.\n\nThat may be especially useful if you want to look at an area that could potentially help determine where to find the water for a vacation or just take another look.\n\nSorensen said he and his team are especially interested in the fact that we are now starting to see other places that could share the same geography as the lake.\n\n\"I just found more and more people asking to go into the lake. It's been called the 'Canyon Lake,' but maybe this lake is in the Pacific Ocean, or maybe they're just really cool,\" he said.", "length": 742, "ended": true}

However, her statement said that no-one could know to what extent this was because there were no-one's sense of how well-regulated a country's food supply was.\n\nThe EFS has said that some of its work in the UK had begun by analysing a number of data sets and taking into account some \"small changes in the EU legislation\".\n\nHowever, this report was a \"very small minority\" of cases and it could \"significantly\" affect the numbers reported if the number of complaints about the food it was carrying continued across EU member states.\n\nDr Gaddam added that while the reports were limited, there was still no need for any-one to assume there was no risk of any serious illness resulting from eating fresh food in a UK country. Nor did any-one expect a rise in the number of deaths when consumption of imported food was reduced by more than a percentage point over the last 15 years across the EU.\n\nShe said the UK and Ireland had already agreed for a review of standards for food safety and agreed to increase their support for developing such measures to ensure there could be no risk of an outbreak of foodborne illness from eating local produce or food contaminated with dangerous chemicals.\n\nDr Gaddam had said that EU member states had made more informed decisions than the UK because of data which had provided different conclusions on the impact of foreign food imports on the UK's food safety situation.", "length": 594, "ended": true}

{"id": 250157, "text": "I've been wondering in the past whether you want to be a part of an upcoming comic that was announced and we're already getting that off the ground. But, like your previous comics I'm not interested in it.\n\nThat doesn't mean that you don't want to be involved in something that will actually happen! I'm not against comic book conventions, however! The only way for fans to find your voice is to join my comic club and show your support, both in writing and in a public space.\n\nI've only recently started to get some interest in that. Some of you might already know me as an avid comic-book fan, so I thought I'd post these questions here.\n\nQ: What's the biggest challenge you've faced over the last year going from \"not in comics\" to \"working as a writer\".\n\nA: I haven't had this in my life and I don't have the time to deal with the issue of being that comics guy all the time. On a regular basis my issues have done well on average. If it was any other issue, I'd be really pissed. I still can't understand how some people would think \"I have to be a comic book nerd because I'm really into comics, but you never know when someone's gonna pull some of those out and use them to take off all these super cool new ideas...\" They never do because comics really change the industry. There are new creators all around the world and everybody can take the job at any time. So it's really not a big deal. The biggest challenge is that not everyone can take the job. When I started and started to work there was a lot of pressure placed on me to do good on comics. But I had to do all the hard work and my job was done.\n\nQ: You're not \"writing as a writer\".\n\nA: For me that's really not the case anymore! I started doing this because there is a huge problem with people who are really struggling. A lot of people think that comic books take away from their creative side. Even my wife had an issue about her \"new creative project\" with a black character who wanted to go back to her \"New Art\" with a woman to help her with it. So my wife tried a project with a \"new art\" character named Sue (the main character in my book). I never would have been doing that if she had said to him, \"Well, you never know at what moment Sue wants to go back,\" but in my opinion it's the wrong thing to do. This is not about me trying to improve my artistic skills or anything that happens to be in the works. This is just an experience.\n\nQ: For example, how will you be able to go to The Flash and learn from them, in terms of their comic style/story?\n\nA: They're so great! I think I'll go as far as I can with that as I possibly can and get to know some people in the future.\n\nQ: How does The Flash, as a writer, feel?\n\nA: I don't know! It's really just a question of how I am reacting to it and what I would do if that person was in my own world or not. I'm just a good writer and I think what works is to know what I want to write about, and not necessarily the work's story. For me to be able to go back to a world with The Flash and do my own work is truly amazing.\n\nQ: Which comic book characters is coming forward today?\n\nA: It's all going to be announced. I'll post a picture of each with one of those if I can.\n\nQ: Any news on The Flash?\n\nA: This character has been on my radar a long time. If I don't get the one I thought I would get the last time, it's definitely going to be a one. But, once The Flash is up, it's up to me to figure out how The Flash will develop over time.\n\nQ: I'm not sure if they'll start with the X-Men, or maybe something darker.\n\nA: I'm not sure but, once they do a deal with Batman and maybe maybe the Guardians, it'll be hard to see when they will be on a show.\n\nQ: I wonder what you'll be doing as an artist?\n\nA: I'm currently doing some small projects. A little bit of a comic with Wonder Woman. I'm already starting a character I want to do, but don't know exactly when.\n\nQ: What is your favorite part of being a comic editor?\n\nA: I'd love my character to become an editor.\n\nQ: What's the most important job that you wish you could do on an artist's career?\n\nA: Just getting to know people and being a good person.\n\n", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

This study investigated the association of genetic variation as well as socio-economic status on the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders and related symptoms among African American populations. In addition to African American males, the sample included a large sample of African American men. The association between prevalence of multiple genetic subtypes of autism spectrum disorders and the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders in African American males was calculated by including an index of race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Using the same index, the authors estimated rates of diagnoses for 1.1 million African Americans between 2007 and 2013. The prevalence of autism spectrum disorders and related clinical conditions in African American males was substantially higher (95% confidence interval: 1.3 to 0.7), and the prevalence of these disorders was significantly higher in African American males who had ever received any education. Further, the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders among African Americans was 1.8 million for males ages 5 to 18 years and 2.6 million for females. These analyses suggest that genetic variation influences the distribution in African American males as well as among African American females, and perhaps even male infants.", "length": 270, "ended": true}

For the moment, a crowd of more than 50 supporters made their way to the bus shelter near their apartment building in the area where they were holding hands. Their leader, Nihil Saeed, said, \"We want to express our love for the Pakistani people. But, we also want to fight for the people in this neighborhood like they fought for us.\"\n\nSaeed's remarks were the first time that he has spoken directly to Pakistan and its leaders since the September 11 attacks, when he appeared before a military court in Islamabad last year and said, \"There is no excuse for using our citizens' power against us.\"\n\n\"We are not happy about such statements. We do not want to provoke our people when we see the use of power by others.\"\n\nSaeed, a retired Army general since 2012, has led a team of Pakistan security guards who have been tasked by a previous administration as a source of manpower for intelligence and other security services in the southern Pakistani city of Jaiz-e-Ittee, in part to assist police officers with security. He has also been in contact with other members of the Pakistani Taliban.\n\nA senior senior Pakistani-American intelligence officer, speaking directly to Reuters in June 2013, described Saeed as providing an \"explanatory language and intelligence\" for Pakistani Taliban to attack civilians, especially those seeking \"social and political change.\"\n\n\"It isn't to take away from Pakistan if we have any sympathy for what our people are doing,\" the anonymous operative, who did not want to be named, told the magazine. \"We want to help them, we want them to be happy and they want to fight for us.\"\n\nFor more than two decades, the Pakistani Taliban have operated out of the southern city, just a few miles beyond the Pakistani capital Lahore, where they have set up operations to advance their cause.

We need people in Lahore ready to fight.\"\n\nSeed said his goal is to provoke Pakistan's army to act \"at the grassroots\" by \"defence the people.\"\n\nIn a similar vein, some Pakistani intelligence officers have said that intelligence gathering will be crucial to defeating the Afghan Taliban unless a new Pakistani-backed regime in Kabul is placed in charge.\n\n\"The Pakistanis and our allies need our assistance to protect the people against the terrorists that is the Taliban,\" said one intelligence officer from Pakistan's elite security forces. \"We need our military men to protect those who come within our reach.\"\n\nThe number of Pakistani Taliban, which represent about 13 percent of Pakistan's population, has fallen dramatically in recent years, with Pakistan's Taliban now numbering 1,100 on average, according to Statistics Pakistan's annual report.

We just went to different places and made out, did our best to talk each other and don't get in trouble.\n\nOn my first day, I got a call from another user that my team was on it. It was from a friend of mine that worked on an online game called Dungeon Keeper.\n\nI told him about my experience, and how excited I was about using your service. He told me a lot about it. He was excited about how many emails we could get with it. I sent his emails back and forth on things like how I was going to get one of my email clients.\n\nThis got me excited. I kept repeating: if it wasn't for you, I'd lose my job. When my team went through my email, I couldn't keep track of what I was sent about. I'd look up where I got the requests about me and my clients, which I had gotten from another person, but not from someone I trusted.\n\nI didn't know which email I should use but I knew I hadn't used all of it. I would think about all the email I used and think of all the times I went through emails. I used to think I'd get some great advice from a friend that had recently started using email.\n\nI went to another person for an email with their advice and just kept asking questions. I asked for their emails to be sent before one of them finished sending emails. This was not really an option for me.\n\nIn my mind, this was the time when I wasn't really using email with my colleagues, because I was still able to manage the team. At the end of the day there was no money there. I only tried to send it to someone and not a group of people, because I would not want those people to feel overwhelmed.\n\nBy the end of May 2014, my team had already started using email through them.\n\nThe biggest challenge for me was figuring out when I felt \"off\". In a sense, I wasn't really off at all. I was always on the phone with my coworkers, and when people started to use their email account, it was hard for me to focus on the job at hand.\n\nWhen I started to lose track of my work, I lost interest in it and eventually became frustrated as to what I could do to avoid it.\n\nMy life was changing a lot by the day. The job I had on the way in France was the way I wanted to go.\n\nThen the news came out of a friend of mine that had been working for a major game company. He was the one who had asked me about her. She asked me what kind of games she'd recently seen or played and I said some of them I thought I would enjoy.\n\n\"My friends and I are having lunch together,\" the friend of mine was saying. I smiled, took a bite, and I left it to her.\n\nI remember how hard it was to tell her that I was working for a major game.\n\nThe next day, she got a call from the boss of the game company. He said:\n\nHe was going to let you do some things, then he said, 'You can send my email to my friend'\n\nI didn't get to that. I took the email and called him back to say I got to send it and give him no notice. I", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 250172, "text": "Skiing\n\nSkiing in the West Indies is not one to be missed. The club has played an impressive number of internationals under its charismatic manager Sam Smith, but the success of the team and the team's results over the past two seasons has seen them get through the World Cup with good results and are the only team to consistently win matches in the World Cup. That is not to say that the team is all that good, especially when it came time to play against Australia in the World Cup.\n\nThis would not be an easy challenge for a team in the Premier League. It certainly isn't an easy task for the English team. It is only fair that in this day and age one team will do what they do best. It is almost as if the Indian side would rather go head to head than play a few overs when they face each other in the quarter-final. That will only make the difference in the final. That was the case for a few days for the Indian teams on November 10, but this was the first time India and England were in the final since the end of India's group competition against Sri Lanka on Wednesday. There had been a lot of talk of team selection in this tournament, the World Cup taking place in the first half but India and England are in a league of their own and the final will be a bit strange.\n\nThe World Cup will probably be the biggest day of the team's lives when they play against England. It is a time that will be difficult especially when teams want to avoid being taken out by the English and the West Indies have shown themselves to be capable of winning even more. The best thing for both teams is to play a good game and try to win the series. It will be difficult to be a top-four player in the world without scoring three or four and the hope being that this final in England, will also be one that they can be proud of.\n\nThe fact that the squad are having a good play-off with the top two sides was also the reason why, with a few exceptions, they were not invited to the World Cup. India and England were both a bit disappointed after finishing seventh with their group game. The one thing that stood out from this game was that it was not a good start for either side. The team was not very good with their pace and possession. That was a good start for the team but the first two overs would not provide much of a break for the rest of the game. The second, very disappointing overs was not that much different.\n\nIt is no surprise that when their first ball in the opening minute of the game came from a man, it was scored by the same individual, who appeared to be bowling the ball to the back of the ball. In the third, we saw a few of the best balls in the match but as soon as he had started to make any play for himself, he began to get down on them. This is the type of player that will allow the team to have an impact at every stage of the game. That player is Sam Smith who has produced an amazing performance and was part of that World Cup win.\n\nSmith looked great in the first, though. He had a solid innings in first. He made a couple of errors on his first ball and even made a run in the third. All those things showed an excellent bat and he seemed to have the ability to get in on the attack. In the eighth of the match, he was also very good off the back of his delivery. That is a very good bat at this level and he has not let the team down so far. That will certainly prove important to the team throughout the World Cup in the summer for the squad.\n\nI don't know how he did against the West Indies. I doubt he did a bit of good things against Sri Lanka or the U-17s at the same time. But he did create one of the better scores in the second innings of the match. All those things did not come together like many people would expect. There is a time when you play the game and if you can do that, then you've got a shot and you're good at that. At this time on the day, it would be good to remember if there are any games that do not have that same effect.\n\nSkiing in the West Indies could not have been more disappointing. The team seems to have given up and the results were quite disappointing though. In the middle innings of the final, we saw that they were all quite strong against a team who was having a rather good start to the World Cup. It was a good start for India and they will take that into game two. It was a great performance in the middle innings so long as teams are capable of doing it on occasion and don't let this be part of the equation. Of course, that would have been a good sign by England.", "length": 1006, "ended": true}

{"id": 250174, "text": "Rationale\n\nThis article is a bit of a long one, but given the content above I have decided to do some things to explain my opinion on the case over the next couple months. The best case I have seen for an actual case is what happens when you're a big, successful company with a huge community of talent. Even if you don't have that community you still can become very passionate about this cause.\n\nSo I decided to write a post that might shed some light on why we're doing this, and maybe the cause. Well, this is the one I thought I'd give you a heads up on.\n\nThe \"I am a Big Team\" Myth\n\nWhat does the big team mean?\n\nThe first time I wrote this article I just looked up \"crowdfunding\", \"revenue sharing\", the name people use when they say to each other that they'd like to start their own company, and \"profit\" as they're used to it.\n\nSo, I'll try and explain the big, successful, self-starter company that started here (there's tons of examples here if you're interested though). I've also included quotes from some of the other top companies over at VentureBeat or Forbes.\n\nIf you're a big company looking to do something big this is what you'd consider as a big team, so here he begins:\n\nCrowdfunding is by and large a successful, scalable, and cost-effective way for your company to grow. If you are a huge business, and you want to raise money, you need to be funded. I would love to hear what you think about this new revenue sharing philosophy.\n\nThe Problem with Crowdfunding\n\nThis is one of the most common issues when I discuss crowdfunding. I know people are excited by being able to get their money on a company, but do they want to join up?\n\nNo.\n\nHow Can I Support Another Big Company (or an Organization)?\n\nWhen it comes to crowdfunding, no one will give you money in the first place.\n\nYou have your friends, family, and/or even the company that you would like to get to know before joining your company. So, just by signing up you actually give these people money for the benefit of the organization you want to work with for the next couple years.\n\nSo, how do you support other companies as soon as you sign up for another job?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm absolutely pro-work/loose. It's not about \"just working one day to keep the team together\" or \"working with this group for three years\".\n\nHowever, there are times of when you might not be ready to be fully committed to a company. At times you might want to ask yourself, \"what does this all mean, what will I be able to do when I am ready?\" This is because in many cases it is something you know already and want to do to get your money. But the problem is that you might think those things to be impossible before you even sign up on your first job. Maybe that's because you didn't do any work as you would have liked. Maybe you would have been waiting 3-5 years to get your life back together before you came up with the idea to do things the way you wanted them to be done. Maybe you didn't have any knowledge at all about the business that you were hoping to create.\n\nOne of the hardest and least understood parts of fundraising is the concept. This is probably the hardest place in the world to start your own company because you could end up having huge problems for yourself when you go to work. It is difficult because there is always plenty of resources that have to be put forth, there are no guarantees that you will be able to get what you want for 3 years before you really reach the goal.\n\nWhy Would Companies Become Crazy About Crowdfunding?\n\nYou are always going to have a tough time getting your money back when you sign up. So, in order to help you get better at your marketing, you need to go back to basics.\n\nYou don't just want your company to have great marketing. You also need to know that your organization will be financially well-managed in the long run, so that you don't have to spend as much time trying to meet and exceed your revenue. Also you need to understand that it is often best to only pay out when you can get the full amount by asking to see someone or getting that person a call with a few hours to sit down for some cash.\n\nI have seen some companies with their founders give \"what have you got,\" but then you have to \"get to work.\" Or you have to \"pay a fee to the company\" or \"we'll pay some back to you.\"\n\nThere are a lot of ways around this as well.

{"id": 250177, "text": "Gingerbread Cookies \u2013 Creamy, Nutty & Gluten-Free (I've only used these so far, and I love the way they come apart at the seams!) It is always perfect to have a mix of cookies for dessert or snacks. I use a few of my favourite pastries to decorate my cookies, so don't put the whole treat down!\n\nCooking tips & recipe suggestions for your perfect dessert cookie:\n\nChocolate Chip Cream \u2013 When frosting your Cookies, use melted chocolate chips. A simple way to do this is to combine a few chopped chocolate chips with 1/4 cup of ice cream, and then add a little bit of whipped cream, to make a chocolate chip. I'll give you the recipe below, as they are all made with my personal chocolate chip recipe from Cooking Tips & Recipe Desserts, so I recommend making them like that. It adds flavor and just really makes these cookies moist and delicious.\n\nCinnamon-Lover Cookies \u2013 I make many different kinds of cinnamon cookies for this cookie recipe. I also make some for lunch, as I like to be a little nutty with it too. I keep some and cut a few with my knife for the base and a touch of cinnamon, just for crunch. If you plan on adding some cinnamon, then I will add it to your cookies, as it makes them less so it is not only more crunchy but I will also add a few cloves to add a hint of cinnamon spice to the cookie cake.\n\nLemon Lime and Pepper Cookies \u2013 Lemon Lime Cookies are usually used with some desserts (such as chocolate chip cookies) but they are a little trickier to make. You will need to mix 1/4 cup of lemon juice with 1/4 cup of sugar. In the recipe below, you could add 1 tsp of lemon juice and just add one cup of sugar, add 1/4 cup of lemon juice to your mix, you can add anything you like.\n\nCinnamon-Pepper Cookies \u2013 If you add more lemon juice and 1/4 cup of sugar, you will need to add to this, or you will really need another pinch to make sure to keep it nice and creamy (if you haven't, you don't really need to add this to your cookie mix, you just need to sprinkle some on top). A nice touch is to add a pinch of cinnamon on top of each and every bite so there is a little taste for the sweetness of the cookie, but at the same time not over powering.\n\nBacon Stuffed Pecan Cookies \u2013 Bacon Stuffed Pecan Cookies are a good option for baked in place desserts with a little cream. These cookie cakes tend to have a little more texture or sweetness to them, and they can also be eaten at a later time as well to have your cookies with a bit of a texture (I usually like to have them in a bowl and put them on top of my muffins to make them a nice dessert for the family).\n\nChocolate Chip Cookies \u2013 I think it is best to bake this right before dessert, as they will give you more flavor and texture depending on how much the cookie cakes have been baked. I make these cookies using my family favorite cookie recipe from Cooking Tips & Recipe Desserts, which I love to make, so I add them right before you and then put them back on top afterwards if you want them too!\n\nPecan Candy Cookies \u2013 While these are great on a warm day, they require as much ice cream as any other cookie I make or put them on top. You can also cut out some candy for your candy and add a bit more, either on the top or in the center. They make so much more chocolate and it takes more and I will add a little bit of a bit of that too.\n\nCinnamon Stuffed Pecan Cookies \u2013 I use a little extra cinnamon on top of these, but I will also add a bit more and add more icing if you wish! You will love the texture as well.\n\nPecan Frosting Cookies \u2013 While this is often done with your kids food prep and other things, you could choose any day of the year for this to turn into a special dinner, or you could use them for as a quick dessert too!\n\nHow to make these amazing desserts!\n\nI love to make and use this recipe to decorate your cookies that they have your all to themselves. If you make these, and you don't like the way that they come apart at the seams, just make and bake them in my oven. You'll be so glad you did, though, when I can do a whole day and make a few out of them and then go back and make something else with them that the family will enjoy.\n\nFor the ultimate recipe to make your own desserts, go here!\n\nPrint Chocolate Chip & Cinnamon-Lover Cookies \u2013 Creamy, Nutty & Gluten-Free (11", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 250180, "text": "A little earlier, back in June, Facebook posted a photo of one of its new users. It featured the name \"Erik\" with a small sticker, but we were able to locate the name by looking at the photo on its blog, and the photo had the words: \"If you have an internet connection, we're going to build the first ever open source OpenEmpower app on Android.\"\n\nThat's where it started\n\nTo illustrate the value of open source software, the original blog post, which has more than 7.5 million subscribers, featured a photograph of Erik in action, and also some comments. Erik had said on the original version of the blog that he'd already been working on his idea for a mobile open source community.\n\nWith the open-source community already thriving, Erik had already made some interesting changes to open Source. For example, in June he had updated his homepage to make it clearer that he was working in proprietary ways. He had removed the \"Erik\" tag line on his homepage, added a \"Free on-line developer\" link and added an item called \"How to Use\" to the top of the page that had links to tutorials on Open-Source Software (OSS).\n\nErik had also removed the \"How to use\" link at the time of posting the original article and added a comment about the change on the first page:\n\nIn addition to working with open source projects, Erik has also added the \"New to Open Source\" tag line. You can now see that he's working on his very first project \"Community: Open Tools for Developers.\"\n\nThat change caused some excitement in the community. Users were understandably excited about the news (and many of us are), and said they were excited about their project. But some took to the Twitter page to express their concern and frustration.\n\nAnd in fact, we felt very good about it. Erik was still not done. The next step was to create a forum for the project to create an opinion, so that everyone could contribute. One of those forums, where users would vote directly on things they loved, would be the \"Erik Project's new open source community.\"\n\nErik didn't go along with all of this until November of 2011, when he started talking with the OpenEmpower community, and began adding new features.\n\nSo how do we develop?\n\nAt the time, OpenEmpower had about 10,000 users. One of OpenEmpower's main goals was to bring up those numbers. That led to some community interaction, which became the foundation of the project. But there was plenty more left to do.\n\nThere were a few different kinds of open source developers, but the most significant was the \"Open Source Alliance,\" who became a non-profit in 2010. This community made sure, by putting out their feedback on the community, that their feedback was collected to help shape it and provide for the open standards that they supported.\n\nSince then, people have found that there is much to grow from this community. Some of them started on a project where they took part in open-source development, which made things easy for them to get together. A lot of the communities that I've joined are involved in open source.\n\nAnother important group was the \"Open Source Community,\" which consists of more than 15,000 users, and some of them have even started a project to build open source tools.\n\nThere were a lot of other types of open source developers. But there were also those that were just doing this one project, which became more important with time. We started in February 2011, and over the next couple of months, we gradually got to about 15,000.\n\nThere are a number of changes we've made to manage those numbers. We changed the way that our Community is split up, and removed references to a particular project \u2014 the \"Erik Project.\"\n\nWhen there was discussion on the community about Open Source projects, we did some early drafts of their projects, which they then submitted to the OpenEmpower Forum. After many votes and feedback, we decided to make the project merge. If we were to merge OpenEmpower, it would create a group based on what it had been doing for years.\n\nNow, a user can join a project and decide how he'll contribute to it. So, it's going to be easier for people to participate.\n\nThere's a lot we haven't done on the open-source community.\n\nOne big change is open source is more popular on mobile than on iOS.

The professor then ordered the student to take off for an outside program. The student has now had the school suspended from all classes but has not been given leave from his post.\n\nStudents who had taken their oaths of graduation from St. Anthony's, and had not taken the pledge before, were warned by the administration that if they are to become certified to take the oath, their attendance at the last day of graduation would not be allowed after. Additionally, the University of Minnesota and St. Anthony's also asked them for an investigation by a supervisor, but no such investigation was ever conducted.\n\nOn Wednesday, March 2, students voted for the removal from St. Anthony's all their student life, an announcement that shocked the school. When asked about the decision by the Board of Regents, a student told the news media: \"People don't know my dad.\"\n\nSeveral students told me that there was quite a lot going on at the school. One student told me that he had been warned twice that he could go to his own school where classes were to be conducted. He told me that it was a huge relief to him that the faculty did not take his orders and gave him a free meal for the time being. Another student said that one of the students told him that he could go to a different school so that he could study and \"find other ways to earn an exemption from the whole school.\" Several also noted that if there was a rerun, then it should also get reported.\n\nI am not familiar with the University of Minnesota and St. Anthony's policies or procedures for reruns of major events. However, I have read about the fact that St. Anthony's has been on the brink of a real \"stiff skin\" lately. I heard of the state Senate getting rid of the campus rerun because of the school's \"stiff skin\" problem and that St. Anthony's has become a \"bronze liberal arts college\". I spoke to an elected official of another St. Anthony administration for this story and they confirmed that the university is committed to keeping St. Anthony's as a major community college. The official said that since St. Anthony's is \"stiff and conservative,\" any rerun of a major event would not require a rerun.\n\nFor our time, we will keep you updated as more information becomes available about the rerun.

I have my thoughts and observations of how this first week will play out. I would like to congratulate all for being able to play this past week through the first week of a new league (I thought the schedule looked pretty good).\n\n\nWe're excited to find other great players from this week and are happy to announce that we're running a \"Season Five Playup\" where we will be playing 2 teams each week. I encourage you to look through this first week for your league. We're looking for players with great potential, strong personalities and can be played in both the first and team playoffs.\n\n\nHere is a list of names that will be participating in our first Playup. Keep in mind that we're getting a lot of people who love to play video games, games are fun and competitive, and people love playing sports. If you are playing in another league just so you can play with those in your league, please send us your feedback and questions, especially if you are new to Video Games!\n\n\nThere will be three leagues, each with their own schedule. Please contact us directly to discuss your league, where you're playing, how many games you're playing and what you like playing. Remember, we have many great players out there.\n\n\nWe are very excited to announce that there are 2 different drafts for each team. That may mean a 2 hour pick-and-roll, but it could also mean a 7 minute or 15 minute split and maybe a 5 minute split. This can be fun - it may be hard for both team and player to know each other well in any given game. I'm sure the next few weeks will be more challenging. What do you think is the best way forward for both teams in the future? Let us know in the comments below and I will add more league details.\n\n\nAs always, we do have an \"epic schedule\" that I'm proud to use, but please feel free to leave any feedback you feel is useful to future leagues, and be sure to read about it on the league's official blog.\n\n\nI encourage you to check out the league's official website - www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends.

{"id": 250185, "text": "\nThere are several interesting differences between the two categories of \"low energy\":\n\nLow energy refers to when there is nothing to be done at all. Low energy generally translates to a good sleep, good diet and exercise.\n\n\u2013 refers to when there is nothing to be done at all. Low energy generally translates to a good sleep, good diet and exercise. High energy refers to when there is much energy to be taken away.\n\nA study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that even if the levels of these two nutrients are relatively low, a decrease in energy intake would be enough to significantly damage the body.\n\nScientists used an approach called a non-linear model to explore the relationship between energy intake and body weight, saying that those differences are due to variations in both the energy levels of the food and the level of exercise performed.\n\nOne of the most compelling findings at this point is that \"high energy\" calories \u2013 especially those from the carbohydrates of plant foods \u2013 can lead to \"high energy fatigue,\" one of the main symptoms of obesity.\n\nWhen the level of each energy source is decreased, some of those calories can be burned back to muscle cells just as in the case of low energy.\n\nScientists have also found a connection between a lower body temperature and lower fat mass. Low energy has no measurable effect on body mass without changes in the fat tissue (see below).\n\nIn its 2013 journal Obesity, the World Health Organization noted that the increased weight of obese people had the same health benefits as other chronic diseases like diabetes, kidney disease and cancer, but those conditions were also associated with lower levels of energy intake.\n\nBut what is the relationship between eating more and exercise?\n\nWhat do people do with energy? Many of us do not know what it is you're dealing with, so a review of studies in the early 1970s showed how little knowledge people had about the food sources and energy levels of different foods may have translated into their energy struggles.\n\nIn the 1980s \u2013 a time when people had fewer calories, and had fewer heart rates \u2013 researchers conducted an experiment on diet and exercise for young people, who were all trained for an intense weight loss program.\n\nThey were asked to perform five simple exercises: squats, pull-ups, dips and deadlifts. They were given the same amount of energy and they were allowed to work out the exercises at least half the time on a daily basis.\n\nThe participants were then allowed to do one of the many, many \"high energy\" activities listed above: squats and pull-ups, which were all described in the scientific literature as being in excess of 3 x 3 \u00d7 3 days per week per person.\n\nIn one study, researchers found that the amount of energy a person had to exercise was roughly proportional to that of the number of hours per week they did them.\n\nThe researchers found that the average calorie intake for some people was 6.2 calories per day and there were 24 hours of physical exercise per week for the non-low energy group.\n\nResearchers later found a correlation between body weight and high energy. The researchers found that the lower the fat fat mass and the lower the body weight, better the ability to burn out fat and fat cells, the increase in levels of inflammation and the increase in activity in the brain. The researchers also found that the fat tissue from high energy group subjects was thicker and the red blood cells were more active.\n\nWhy should I care about high energy? Is a lower body temperature just an excuse for calories too low?\n\nThe scientists at the Center for Nutrition at the University of Michigan wondered whether, with increased energy intake, our bodies might be too exposed to high levels of fat. It turns out that the brain was at a high and that energy levels that were significantly lower for low energy people (3.3 and 4.8 calories, respectively) were the cause of this.\n\nDuring the study, participants were told to eat one to two portions a day, and were asked to eat one twice a day.\n\nThe average intake of the higher energy groups was 3.8 calories and only the low energy group did not increase much. Those without a higher body weight (9.9 for the low energy group, 5.6 for the low energy group) ate two per day.\n\nThe effect of these diets on body weight was greater than in the low energy group when it came to body composition. Those for the mid-range energy groups, but not for the high energy group, consumed 3.6% of calories and in some cases ate one to two per day.\n\nIn addition, if people were doing \"high energy\" diets, it was expected that they would be consuming a lot of low energy protein and less than what their energy levels would ideally look like.\n\nThe researchers suggest that if it was expected that your dietary plans would be more balanced, you would want to make up your own mind about how much your", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

Todd (above), who appeared on this week's episode of Game of Thrones to talk about how he felt about the series premiere episode of Game of Thrones, \"Thrones,\" and his favorite character in the series: Tommen. The three-part video interview was co-produced by The Moth, the acclaimed podcast, with Jeff Gerema.\n\nQuestion: On how much work and how much time were you taking for the series premiere episode of Game of Thrones?\n\nTodd: It is quite a long episode, I would say. Actually it's four and a half hours, and then you sit back and you think, \"This is a huge week, so what's going on?\"\n\nWhen a show like that comes out, it's not something that we're comfortable doing, it's something we get scared of doing because the characters are so strong and we love to have that kind of stuff in our life. I think it's important for us, as a show, to show people who love to read that show \u2013 and show them the kind of material they want to read. And there's so many wonderful, fascinating stories and wonderful scenes and great characters around that show that we want people to watch before they think it's going to be a total hit for any one person. So I think we're making great stuff.\n\nQuestion: Did you ever feel like you were spending that much time on the show?\n\nTodd: I always enjoyed writing and acting that first day. What's up in there? It's always entertaining when I do it, but I think it's the first one episode that I wrote, and I'm just always excited about it.\n\nI read The Walking Dead a number of times and my friends said this show should have had a season 1 premiere at the beginning of the show season one, so I think it's always fun to learn new fans as they are coming forward. We're always very grateful when we get a little insight into people before they go off to see a show. Our own season 1 premiere just went off on July 10 (it was not filmed until August 5) and that's one of the highlights! Then we all went off to watch The Walking Dead, just like everyone else! We're in the middle of that one!\n\nWe love to go on and get new stuff from time to time. We're always excited about doing something new and exciting, and we've always loved doing that for Season 2.\n\nQ: You were also introduced to the first and last female-led character in Thrones, Maisie Williams, who also played Tyrion Lannister, and this is a really interesting development. Can you talk about that?\n\nTodd: That's pretty interesting. I have nothing to disclose on that one. Just as the series started, it was definitely a time where you can watch people as they go on their journey, but they never get to see how they feel on their own. A lot of people are kind of caught up on it, and so they're like, \"My goodness, I'll have to see them on my own. Because I love being there!\"\n\nWe're always trying to make the most of what we have there. As the show starts the new season is going to be like that kind of show where you have a lot of really strong characters, and you have this group that does this kind of character that's also been known around for three generations or so. That's not going to be the way this ends up. It's going to look really, really different for season three.\n\nQ: I know fans of the show, from our previous podcast about the show and our next three years, are wondering a lot is the focus on Maisie Williams. Where do you think she's going to go from here on out?\n\nTodd: She's going to be a big part of us now and not just one day and then we can say, \"Hey, we really did this! We're doing it!\" We have so much potential that it's actually going to be so exciting because they had so much potential in us before we even started filming\u2026 And Maisie is going to continue that process in her own way and then she's going to figure things out for us.\n\nThe whole season is just a new beginning. It's never really been a long time\u2026 I think it's just the way we're able to put it on that first day and then you really see it.\n\nQ: What is the greatest thing about Game of Thrones this season?\n\nTodd: I think the moment I watch it, the most amazing thing is I love watching this show go on and that's even before I have an idea of what's going on. You see so many stories, so many great characters, all these ideas, and then I kind of sit back and look at what's going on. I think it's", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

Maybe it takes 4 to 6 weeks, maybe it might take longer? Maybe you still have no idea who you are, what you want to do, who you want to be, and what you want to teach yourself... but the more time you spend working on any of these things, the more interesting it gets.\n\nThis is an interesting question to ask yourself.\n\nWhat do you do with all this time?\n\nIf you're new to job seekers or don't know an answer, take a look at what job seekers do during their first 6 weeks at the job interview and see if you can add a few years of experience in your portfolio. I've found the answer to this, I guess.\n\nWhat About Social Media?\n\nI'm not saying companies should be afraid to use Twitter but it does provide a great way for you to share your work and your vision together. I say this more because Twitter is what it is, and it's amazing. And it's not just about it.\n\nHow about getting to know your coworkers and get a sense of who you work with?\n\nHow do you start your own project?\n\nYou might have heard that a good example is you have a great idea and an amazing team of people working on it. Then it would be easy to talk to those people and then you could just ask them how their idea looks or just say, it looks great and that's really exciting. That might not be as effective or awesome as what you're about to give up on, but it does have the added benefit of giving you a tangible idea of where you stand with the team and how you should get to do something.\n\nThis is also where the next step is finding an easy way to make your company better: find an easier way of saying hello to your customers.\n\nIf you can, share your stories. Share your experiences, stories about finding something to do, and then offer to help your brand.\n\nBut you never really know. You'll also get a little more stuck. Maybe you just want to get more information and a little more visibility and maybe you just feel like you're being targeted by Google. Let's say that happens in the business world and it's because you've started out with a big, established and popular product and a lot of people are interested in doing it.\n\nWhat if I'm at the big company and I'm just looking for a sales manager to run the business?\n\nWhat if I'm working with an international brand or a young, new client and they tell me to \"build a brand in the Philippines\"?\n\nThe best answer is probably \"Build your brand, because that would give you a great position in the company.\" But if your company doesn't have its own brand, it probably doesn't have an international brand!\n\nThen, what if the customer doesn't like the idea at all? Well, you don't have that problem, what's the problem! It's better to have a company that has its own unique brand and they'll love your company, but if they don't like it.\n\nIn an interview, most customers and company's are pretty clear about each other's differences:\n\n\"It's a good idea because if you don't like it, you can change it.\"\n\n\"You don't have the right brand on site. And you don't even know it.\"\n\n\"And nobody's willing to invest in you.\"\n\nAnd of course the customer has the same questions:\n\n\"Well, why am I paying so much?\"\n\n\"Why is my job getting cut in half?\"\n\nAnd of course, that customer is likely to be the one to call.\n\nIf your company doesn't have a unique brand with a strong global brand or market cap, it doesn't have that problem. You might just work on something new.\n\nThe other important thing to remember... is that your company is not unique. It's built on two basic principles.\n\nFirst, your product and services are built in the same place... so you need to create an atmosphere where your product is based and your service reflects that.\n\n\"The customers and the product are the same\"\n\n\"It's easy to find the customer by looking for his features or by looking for the features that you should add to it\"\n\nSecond, your product and services are based in the right places.

After the developers announced the game's release, several employees started taking notes on all the details, and the team was forced to begin to make the game based on the ideas and the ideas of its fans.\n\nAfter the game was released, it was officially announced that, although it was possible for a fan game to be released for one year after the release of the game, for those who liked the project, a release would be required for the release of all its fans. For that reason, the studio decided to put forth the initial effort in this way.\n\nAfter the development of the game started, it was announced that two more members of the team, who would later become the game's main characters, would begin the \"game's development.\" They would be led by Yoko Fujitsugu.\n\nSince the games development team were so young, they had no experience and the team was still under the guidance of their former director, Yuko Takujin, who had been with the team since 1986.\n\n\"The story of Metroid was developed by the team's former boss Yuko Takujin and has since become one of the most acclaimed video game video games ever released, with over 40 million downloaded and sold since its first game's release.\" \u2014\n\nYoko Fujitsugu explains how the development was done: \"The game was developed by Yoko Fujitsugu, who worked for Konami of America in the 1980s and later became Yoko Fujitsugu's editor-in-chief. We made about 80 hours of work available to the community, and we started to develop the game the other day as we had not actually seen the game before.\n\nA few days later, one of the team members started to be notified about the game's release and started to play the game. It became clear that they needed more work; I remember Yoko telling me that he had been thinking about releasing the game for one year. And so the next day, when we started looking through the game's source code, we found all this code. All this code had all the bugs that made the game's name into a joke in the community. So it was a little difficult to understand. But before he could put it all together, we had the opportunity to develop the game.\n\nDuring the \"game's development,\" we began to look into the source code of the game. It really began to make no sense. After the game was released, we began to look into different features for the game, such as in-game menu, special weapons, and other different features. But there were more surprises than the source code. In addition to the original game's source code, some of the features were also discovered by other members of the project. The source of the games code was also shown by many of the members of the team that started the project.\n\nSince we started looking at all our source code, we realized that some of the features that allowed the game to become a big success were also discovered by some members of the team that started the game. It was only when the company had started to work on their first release program that the team came to believe that the game could be made for the first time in any other games due to its popularity and popularity in Japan.

{"id": 250198, "text": "For a moment the idea that there will be a mass exodus of Russian citizens from the Middle East has sounded plausible. It's true that an official Russian government source tells me most Russians have already left in droves. But as far from an absolute guarantee, the official story on the situation in Syria, a Syrian state-run news source, is much more dire. Russian refugees are now getting on with their lives. Russia's Foreign Ministry has said it's ready to send hundreds of additional troops to Syria. Russia's Foreign Ministry called for a halt to any military action in Syria. The fact that no such intervention has been taking place, however, suggests nothing more than a complete indifference to Russia's concerns for international stability in the Middle East. The real issue today in Syria is its ongoing civil war: the most visible example is the Syrian conflict. The crisis is being waged by a very small number of states and the most vocal voices in opposition are Russia and the Gulf states. The Western press are reporting the United States is willing to cut off funding for a number of state bodies (see: China's official response to the crisis in Yemen). But what actually appears to be coming is a new and growing sectarian conflict as the West has been stalling. The Syrian government has been fighting a proxy war between different Kurdish factions while the United States-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes in the skies above Syria to block any such action. No Syrian government official at this time spoke to us with any insight, as that could jeopardize the ongoing civil war and threaten U.S. security.\n\nBut even if you agree Russia has been giving its support while it's engaged in this Syrian conflict, the real issue here is how does the current conflict fit in with the other conflicts in the region? What do you understand about Russia's continued support to these extremist groups and how does this conflict fit into their conflict of interests?\n\nThe first question that comes to mind when looking at this problem is the United States: It has given nearly $300,000 to al Sisi's ruling Sahel Party in Egypt, though that is not an exact science, and yet no U.S. official has commented on who is helping the country to overthrow its government. As for Syria, the only U.S. official who spoke about the situation in Syria to me over the phone was Peter Navarro. He said that he was trying to assess the situation that the Syrian government in fact had in place from the very beginning but has been unable to bring any tangible progress to date. That's why, as I said earlier, when the current crisis was described as a sectarian war, Russia seemed to be in no rush to turn its back on a Syrian regime that is under siege. That means that the international community should be worried, perhaps even wary of Moscow, as it did with the United States in 2014 when it allowed Washington to support an Iranian-backed Syrian army that the Iranians accused of violating international law.\n\nThen there's Russia's \"strategic partnership agreement with other countries for fighting Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.\" (In other words, the United States is supporting the Syrian opposition rather than the Assad regime.) If the agreement is indeed good for democracy in Syria, this agreement provides the United States $5 billion in cash to help the government fight Islamic State, which could be used to bring Syrians to government-run detention centers that would be a useful investment for Iran if it needs to defend itself. But if the agreement is bad for Russia and if the United States refuses to pay for any military strikes in Syria, then Russia will have to find a way to keep getting rid of Bashar al Assad, not just by making military aid to government-armed rebel factions like the Free Syrian Army (FSA), but by not giving it to any government at all and not paying its fair share. We are not going to get rid of Assad after he leaves office unless we start working with the Free Syrian Army. That's the only way that Russia is going to save Syria for future war, and the only way that Russia is going to save Syria from future war is if the Free Syrian Army takes over, which it's already done. But then it needs to get those fighters together. The Russians have been offering to arm them, for some time, but they are not interested in getting rid of Assad. At this point, the only thing they do is buy people, then sell them off and give them to the opposition. There is no more effective solution to the conflict that we are getting.\n\nThe US-led coalition is trying to do everything to help the regime of Bashar al Assad. They hope to capture Assad's town on the Syrian side of the border with Turkey, a move that would help the Assad regime regain some of its control of eastern Aleppo and take control of eastern Aleppo. But Russia opposes this as \"Russian interference\" in the conflict. The West believes the Assad regime are being supported by Al Qaeda and are hoping to undermine the opposition. The US has already said that it is supporting al Qaeda", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

My job as a public school teacher is to ensure that all students have the opportunity to play an important role in the well-being of their communities. It's easy and very rewarding working for your classroom. I think you have a perfect future. The teachers you are teaching at this school should work hard to ensure that your students have a real chance with the teachers you are working with. If you are working for a non-profit who cannot afford the $80,000 to $120,000 per year cost of tuition, that is one less thing to do.\n\nNow, there are some reasons for this. In my case, I spent a lot of time with my best friend, and he was a great support person. Unfortunately, most importantly he was very nervous about his new teacher. He had a hard time getting his hands on these precious teachers. My friends and I came to this school to do our best but he was out of touch, and he also had concerns for my daughter and I. I'm glad that I didn't take to his side and he told us his opinion was \"not mine.\" But I've known my entire life that I'm not happy with my students, and I know the teacher had that same feeling the last time I worked for a non-profit. He gave me great encouragement before he left for the day, and now that I work with a non-profit, he's the only one I can offer a good educational experience.\n\nBut when it comes to the teachers you work with, you just are doing it. If you're unsure what to expect, ask questions of an instructor in your school. If you're unsure about the teachers you're working with, ask them for support and to keep an eye out for other teachers working for non-profits. That way you know that you can be part of something great in your district when it comes to keeping kids safe.\n\nThe only way to make school safe is to do well, and then learn from those failures and try to get better.\n\nSo let me tell you what I hope to achieve with the new Teachers in Charge at this school. If you have any questions about this school, feel free to ask me directly.\n\nI was very impressed with the work you have done at this school on all fronts. I hope you would like to share some of those experiences with others at your school, and I look forward to hearing from you guys on the teachers you will have in your school.\n\nIn addition to the new teachers you currently have, I'd like to invite you to follow my life and to learn more on a daily basis about what I'm doing at this school.\n\nThe New Teachers in Charge (NSO) at this school", "length": 590, "ended": true}
{"id": 250200, "text": "Predictably, there is a lot that can happen right now that could change the way things will be seen around our planet, thanks to the rising cost of fossil fuels.\n\nThere have been many examples where fossil fuel companies have played a role in this.\n\nIn 2005, the International Energy Agency (IEA) ranked fossil fuel companies in the category of most profitable by revenue. But this doesn't mean that any of them were the world's largest operators of polluting infrastructure. In fact, its conclusion that the fossil fuel industry has played an active role in climate change has been widely regarded as a hoax and a false alarm for decades.\n\nEven more shocking, in 2004, an independent study found that fossil fuel companies have donated nearly half its profits to environmental and political causes. The industry has been on the receiving end of political donations since 2008.\n\nYet this study, carried out by the Australian Energy Council, found that only three percent of those surveyed gave more than $300 for public relations.\n\nThis has had massive consequences. And it's not just the fossil fuel industry that's benefitted. The most disturbing aspect of the Climategate controversy is the fact that it has been proven to be a cover to cover-up of climate change's effects.\n\nMany have attempted, and failed, to raise the issue in public. Some of the most recent climate hysteria was uncovered by a group called the Fossil Fuel Resistance Initiative, which ran a video on Facebook and YouTube, with footage of fossil fuel executives including Bill Gates, Paul Singer, and Peter Thiel, in front of tens of thousands of people, where they repeatedly suggested the planet has already warmed.\n\nThe video has gone viral. It was uploaded by Richard Dawkins in 2009 and, in 2015, took over his website and began to spread among other online media.\n\nThis was seen by the entire world of media in August, 2015, when several thousand people gathered in Istanbul and other cities around the world in solidarity with those who were being subjected to the denialist misinformation video \"Climategate\".\n\n\"If anyone is paying attention, this is exactly what it's about,\" said Mike Ritchie, an energy adviser to Greenpeace's CEO, John Maynard Keynes.\n\nIn the video, he pointed out to the viewers of the YouTube clip what a \"disconcerting\" revelation the \"Fossil Fuel Resistance Initiative\" is.\n\nAccording to Maynard Keynes, \"There are two ways to get rid of fossil fuels.\" The first is to use them in the form of \"carbon tax,\" because the emissions are already too dangerous. The second is climate change as a natural cycle, when fossil fuels become more abundant.\n\nThe second way is to stop them from doing so. Maynard Keynes, in his brilliant book The Theory of Everything and All the Things That Make Humanity So Great, also wrote, in a 2012 paper entitled \"We Should Go Clean, Not Fuel up: The Case of Fossil Fuel,\" that:\n\nIt is the only way to combat the pollution of our environment; it is the only way to avoid the devastating consequences of our consumption.\n\nIn 2012, when the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on the Globalization of Contaminated Environmental Products (COFO), Dr. Pierre-Joseph Sartre, proposed the COFO's definition of \"carbon pollution,\" this led to the \"Climategate\" revelations.\n\nSo if the COFO's definition is correct, the global market for COFO chemicals is at least $11 trillion. It's even less than if the CFC, which the UNFCCC labeled \"carbon pollution,\" is not banned.\n\nWe know that the Global Carbon Fund, another industry association, is a leading public relations arm for a \"fossil-fuel-friendly, alternative energy industry.\" As part of that association, they sponsor a campaign to block an \"eco-friendliness\" policy, in which they sell \"the greenest way to get clean energy,\" but are only effective when the cost of COFO chemicals is less than that of carbon taxes (such as the US carbon taxes).\n\nIn 2008, a report by IEA's Global Carbon Fund, funded by the US Department of Energy and the US House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee, described the COFO as \"the first, cheapest fuel for extracting natural resources,\" even though it contains far fewer fossil fuels than the world's average.\n\nThe report concluded:\n\nDespite the enormous cost of COFO chemicals, it can be the only way to stop a large number of these pests from being caught and killed.\n\nIn addition, the report said that many of these pests are already in the process of spreading to Europe, where they are \"already making a great comeback.\"\n\nOn the other side of the coin is the Global Warming Policy Initiative, formed by an organization linked to \"the energy industry\" who says that it has invested $200 million in the creation and implementation of policies that will", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

He lost his temper at a restaurant, called out \"you're having a baby too,\" and then said, \"You're being selfish and giving up your liberty to be a citizen and not be a slave-holder!\" The cops came and arrested the man. You know, and didn't want to let him die out in some kind of fight. Well, they took two years to kill him. He's still a young man and has still not gotten used to life. He hasn't even finished college. So he's had four children and is still at college. But it's just sad, and really, crazy that he isn't taking care of kids like his wife, mother, and kids and not doing a lot of social work, and then all of the sudden having kids.\n\nBut you know? It's not really for your financial security but because you got to keep yourself busy. So, you're not doing it all on your own: the kids are doing their usual stuff.\n\nD: I agree with you, you're saying it. But why did you do that to my children as well?\n\nCB: Well, just not to be selfish, I don't understand. In fact, I think it's because you know, it has been done repeatedly here on the law in Chicago to get our children into law school without their parents making it easier, in my case, they got our money and we were able to pass it on. I mean, we know we didn't have to do anything, but I don't think it's even the first time this law has been applied to someone. And in any case, it had to be done before we got married and children started school again. And they were so close to raising us this past year and we didn't want them to see us grow into them. Now, when our kids're six or seven, I don't think we have that much opportunity to make progress. But we've got our money and my children should have the best education possible, and they should have to be able to get out of school and have a good life, as long as they have other benefits like healthcare and their kids are good teachers and social workers.\n\nD: The reality is that you may be able to get out, but a family law case isn't a guarantee of a decent standard of living in Chicago.\n\nCB: I think it's a pretty good example of a lot of things that can happen under the guise of an individual right to a fair standard of living. So, you're not only allowing that, you may be making a big deal out of it.\n\nD: I wouldn't say that there's anything wrong with that.\n\nCB: But that is, in fact, something you could do on any of the other kinds of issues, from criminal trespassing to driving under the influence, that we've got under the law that's supposed to protect that sort of situation.\n\nD: But you have your kids going out and doing a lot of work, getting the right kinds of jobs. That's all very different. Because we live in an industrial, urban society. So many of us, many of us, many of us \u2014 we see cities, we see suburbs, we see a lot of urban neighborhoods, we see other parts of the country. You have the suburbs which were built in the 80s and 90s. And we're still seeing some great change, great cities like Seattle, the people of Seattle being able to live in what's a fantastic, vibrant, vibrant community there. So, you have a lot of places that are so great and where we live. And if we don't make improvements, and we have to leave, or lose our jobs, where we should have more people, where we have access to the jobs that they need and have the good jobs and the good incomes that we have, then that's just not how we live.\n\nD: You're suggesting that the real reason why a lot of the stuff we're talking about is for good reasons or because \"our kids are doing great for themselves and getting better off.\"\n\nCB: Yes.\n\nD: They're doing good for themselves. And they do well in their families. That's just not right, in my opinion, for our kids to do well and get better off, because they're more intelligent and they're going to have more fun. And that's just not right and we must get smarter and learn better. I think when those two things are combined, that, to give them the right kind of social and economic rights, they do much better than their parents.

You're dealing with some sort of big mess, and when your brain starts over and starts over again, it can't help but turn into a messy mess.\n\nThe second thing that comes to mind, however, is the fact that you're supposed to look at the problem in a positive way and treat it with respect, because this doesn't really need to be your last word. All you need to do is act, not be arrogant or say something stupid about it, and you're getting right what you said. That's all you really need to do is try to remember all those lessons.\n\nThe last thing you need to do is talk about how you've been feeling. You don't need to be going back and forth about the story of your life that's been going on over the years. This is where we get our hands on, and the first lesson in how to deal with this mess is learning to recognize when you're having this weird and odd thing to do that's so frustrating.\n\nSo, what, exactly, did your grandmother call you?\n\nWell, she called you back from an errand or something that you'd been missing. When you told Mom she'd called, she thought about that question. She didn't feel like I was going to tell her all that.\n\nAnd then she went home and told you that she's been missing.\n\nI mean, she was a really nice girl, I guess. She told you every day. I mean, she didn't talk much in the morning, or after-school. My dad told me she had left in a car accident that morning. This happened pretty early and had just stopped.\n\nI remember saying, \"Hey Mom, I need you to come back with me.\" She was really surprised at that. She had given me everything.\n\nWell, she did. A week later she was back with her and I was still up. She told me all about the car accident so I knew that she was okay. There had been a couple of things happening so quick that, of course, I was nervous then, and I'd never seen her before. So, that's pretty good timing for what happened.\n\nThe third lesson you need to take away from this is that you need to learn to deal with emotional issues when things are bad. You need to pay attention to that problem and you need to make sure that everything comes together and does what it has to do to help the good person in question.\n\nIt takes a lot more than just being upset, but there are some things you can teach yourself to do to help others. And we're talking about what some people do to themselves and how to deal with those emotions that they're feeling.\n\nIn the book \"What Makes People Care?\" by Laura Thompson, she describes what an amazing job that her team at LoveBox is doing. So, one of the things I think we all understand in that book is that there's no one set goal where you can just fix everything and put it on the way.\n\nSo, there you have it.\n\nI mean, here's what she had to say about what we're trying to do in our book with this book. I think she felt pretty positive about that. The fact that we've developed a strategy for finding ways to treat people's emotions and not fix what they're feeling from the inside isn't a coincidence, but it's something we thought might be a little surprising to a very few readers.\n\nI think it might even be surprising to a lot of people who are just discovering this book, because these days I never tell people about it. I'd rather tell people that we're learning how to talk to you about your emotions, and you're in good company. This has to be a lot more of a challenge than that.\n\nOh, I just love telling people about this book. I'm really happy with how we're doing it. It's really fun to read it.

The U.S. and its coalition partners then started sending more soldiers and equipment to bolster their offensive. The U.S. and coalition airstrikes started in 2006 and had not yet begun, Pentagon spokesman Glen Johnson told Reuters, adding that the U.K. and other international forces were already doing so in areas not under its control, at which point \"we became more involved in the broader coalition effort.\"\n\nThe Times report cites documents from U.S. military officials, and the Department of Defense, which says that American aircraft were involved in \"an unprecedented multi-faceted multi-day ground attack campaign\" against Islamic State.

Hays, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and her colleagues analyzed data gathered by GPS tracking data taken by a pair of satellites orbiting Mars that were tracked over Earth over the last two decades.\n\nTo figure out the origin of the Earth-moon landing of the Apollo 13 astronauts, they compared data collected from both satellites as the two launched from San Francisco during September 2001 (their arrival is unknown) and on September 16, 2003 (their departure is known to be known).\n\nBoth satellites took photos from a 3.3-megapixel digital camera.

{"id": 250210, "text": "\n\"There's a growing gap between the rich class and the poor,\" said Michael Gough, Professor of Economics at Columbia University. \"The most vulnerable people and those with the least resources do worse in the rich classes than the rest of the populace, which can make the economic system more complex and inefficient. The middle class, on the other hand, is also struggling to develop and compete with the rest of the population, and thus its economic performance should be relatively weak.\n\n\"The more advanced the classes, which have stronger infrastructure, and access more people to markets and information,\" he continued, \"the more efficient the economy will be. The more advanced the wealth distribution, the less competition people have in terms of purchasing power and wages. There will be much less competition in terms of housing. There will be much less competition in terms of public education. The economy will also have improved so much over the past half century \u2026 that the economic system needs to evolve to accommodate the population and the resources that it has traditionally been the dominant economic system.\n\n\"This growth is not as smooth as that in the mid-20th century when the middle class was able to compete with the other groups of people \u2026 but the way it will continue as the years go on is more difficult and more complex.\"\n\nHe added: \"Even the rich have made progress in many things. I mean, for example, they are making more than in the 70s before and 80s before. But they are not just moving away from the poor. They are also making it more efficient to bring wealth into their country. The rich are moving in for better jobs and higher living standards than they do. This is an improvement over the previous three decades, so it was never a good thing for our country. It wasn't really a good thing for either of us, though, because we also have to think about our values as a whole. We have to make our own decisions.\"\n\nThe United States is ranked 31st in the world in the wealth and income gap between rich and poor, with 21st of all developed countries.\n\nLast year's presidential candidates spent just under $25 billion on ads in their home state, California. But they also spent almost double that on television ads that focused on the poor and the middle class \u2014 about 20 percent of that total money. That's double what they spent in 2013 and 2008.\n\nThe median home sale price in New Jersey went up a little over two years and reached one-third its peak during the 2000s. The median home sales price in California now stands at $741,000.

{"id": 250218, "text": "In the case of the KG-40, we have three major issues at hand.\n\nThe first, which we will discuss below, is the lack of high impact anti-aircraft gun rounds. The AKA \"anti-aircraft guns\" are now the primary issue against German armed air power units. We have seen in the past that both of these items exist, and that it is possible to provide high-impact air-to-air rounds with the new HK-40, despite all its drawbacks.\n\nThe second, which we will discuss below, is the lack of light anti-fire missiles in the case of the AKU-9M. While the latter could provide short range anti-aircraft fire from high altitude, many aircraft are armed with relatively short-range anti-aircraft weapons that are far from optimal: the Baffler and the M1921. We can't afford an AKU-9M in the US, where heavy aircraft have so little range, and for which there is little chance of providing low-impact air-to-air missiles.\n\nFinally, the third issue we will talk about is the lack of a high-tech high speed bullet in the case of the HK-36. After all, one must have low-tech high speed bullets to provide adequate protection against air power vehicles, and this has created many issues for the AKU-9M. It is worth noting that while the AKU-9M may perform perfectly in the open field, a few rounds would kill it.\n\nThe HK-36's performance during World War II was similar to many high-tech anti-aircraft rounds. It was not equipped with air rifles like the Baffler, or with more accurate long-range missiles such as the Fuhrer. A single shot from a high-speed bullet would almost certainly kill any air-to-air missile, especially one so short-ranged as the Baffler (or even M1921, due to its high speed). The Fuhrer had a range of 50-250 m. A single hit from the HK-36 would be enough that a few rounds would kill it by itself. The result was very limited coverage: no accurate high-speed bullets, and the average gunnery performance of a single shot from a high-speed bullet was around 40-60%. The high speed bullets are extremely difficult to fire, and have long range that is more than 200 meters away from a target with no warning.\n\nAt the same time, the HK-36 is extremely difficult to use on the open field of battle. The main problems arise when a light air-to-air round or a low-grade air-to-air round are used. While these are difficult weapons and are usually very powerful (the Fuhrer has a maximum range of about 15, and a minimum range of about 60 miles without warning, according to the most recent data from Soviet Russia), one can also be highly effective when they are fired directly from the KG-40. All of the above problems are the result of a lack of high-speed anti-aircraft rounds, the fact that these rounds are so poorly designed and have no short-Range anti-aircraft air-to-air rounds. The main weakness of one's medium-sized fighter is that it tends to fall flat in long, straight-line straights.\n\nAn alternative solution to this problem is the development of a high speed bullet of the same caliber and type, but with a different bullet. The HK-36 is similar to the GX-39 (and also other types) in that it is an intermediate caliber, and not particularly light. This makes it difficult for it to perform as a high-strength high-density anti-aircraft weapon, though. It makes it difficult for it to take down, and it makes it particularly difficult for medium planes.\n\nThe best defense against a high-speed bullet depends on its quality. Many high-speed bullets are difficult to fire, which means they require high-velocity air-to-air rounds (L-AR) for good protection. High speeds and high velocities, in fact, can be the primary issue with a well-equipped L-AR. That leaves the Baffler and M1921 when it comes to protection against low velocity air, but this does not mean that it cannot be used as a high-velocity weapon. The Baffler and M1921 are the best defense against air-to-air rounds.\n\nThere are some excellent options from which to choose: high speed, medium size guns, and a low-velocity air-to-air round. But all of them need to be developed according to the design principles of particular types. In short, the development of the right kind of anti-aircraft air-to-air rounds for the M1921, M1922 with a good range, and high speeds will not be a problem", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

I haven't heard any of this from her or the police. Now let's get on with this. The man went to a house for a ride and he heard the scream, and it was like one huge shot with the shotgun, hitting my son in the groin. So then he turned around and saw that all the windows on the house had been broken and his car was broken with this big hole that he called 'Lil Baby' in his head. The guy that said that they shot my son in the groin could no longer walk and was not even in his apartment, so he grabbed his gun and took it away. He grabbed it from me and fired the last shot into the hole. The little girl was screaming, and as I was screaming that I could not walk, a white dude came flying over my head like a bird. A white dude came flying over me a very scary bird. The guy who had gotten caught in that shot started screaming to me, \"Oh my God, that's my son. He can't walk.\" I ran outside and yelled for help, and I don't know what the last words were and I heard him start screaming and saying 'God, I'm afraid I'll never see him again'. A small boy came running up the stairs and I heard the police telling me that a white man, who is still there in his wheelchair, was trying to get out of that hole. The little boy, who was in his first wheelchair, died later in hospital. The woman was at that place a week and a half ago. She ran away and called 911 to say 'It's just that boy. She's so scared.' The two of us went from there. The boy's a big boy and so scared because all police were saying was that that little boy had been walking all the way on the floor so he was scared and he couldn't look past. That little boy was very scared. That little boy's still here. He's a big boy again and now he's coming down in the hospital. So he's still afraid. I've heard and I know what happened to him. He went to the hospital for what seems like months and months of medical treatment and it went on for years without him ever being seen there, and his family didn't ever come down from where he was. I heard he still had his family members here today. So when he was still in the hospital they just kept him here and he's not going anywhere. Because then he just went flying back down to New York. He just didn't exist. In that little little hospital it's really hard to say anything except to let him know that somebody has come and taken his son from him. At the last minute there was no telling what to say. The hospital officials, the doctors, the nurses, all those staff from all over the area just kept getting in and out of there at this exact moment. What happened to his body and everything was like a nightmare because the first time the police took him out of there, my oldest son was in a coma, and a lot of people came after me and accused me of doing something to him and that it was not just my fault. So I told them that and that if it wasn't for her and all this stuff and that's why they sent her there, I'm not gonna come back. And that's how they got involved now all of an old friend gone. I don't care if he survived his hospital, any little family member of mine, I still remember him.

And, so, when people do that, they mean something. That's just reality. A lot of times, I hear this. It's like that. We're just human beings. We have bodies and we fight. Sometimes we fight back. Sometimes they beat us. Our bodies try it and it kind of makes us all sick. Our bodies really get tired before we fight back. So when people do that, it's like we fought back before they beat us. So we gotta fight back.\n\nThat might not always be what they're looking for. But it'll be the right thing to do.\n\nMICHELLE JAKINS, HOST:\n\nWelcome to the second of three. Today I'm joined by NPR News' Melissa Jackson, author of \"The Killing Fields: The Story of the World's Columbine Children.\" Her documentary, \"The Killing Fields: The Story of the World's Columbine Children,\" came out as part of NPR's new national program, \"The Killing Fields.\"\n\nNow, what's happening in Colorado this weekend is going to be a major blow for parents and their children. We've got to get the public out and to look for solutions. You know, we have a lot of unanswered questions.\n\nNow, some of it has to do with your children's upbringing in Colorado and the Columbine School shooting in Colorado Springs, Colo. And that has to do with education, as you know. And there's been, it goes without saying, the number of kids killed in Colorado this year. And of course, this isn't a matter of where the guns are, it's an issue of what you can do.\n\nWell, it's been a lot of talking about guns recently in Colorado schools. When kids in Colorado see pictures of their guns, they have to understand that these are some of the things they want the parents to be responsible for, that they understand.\n\nYou've seen that on CNN and NPR, where President Obama has been saying, \"You gotta be aware of what guns are in your system.\" But there's another problem with that, and that's that some states have laws that force parents to make changes to their kids' gun laws.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nIn Colorado recently, lawmakers and parents in those states have to be told it won't happen to them anymore. It's been said that it will happen to them.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSo what can kids do to fix this problem? It depends on how you look at it.\n\nMICHELLE JAKINS: You know, I think there are problems at stake in the United States of America. What we need to do is get people out to participate in the democracy around the world. And that can happen if you help them get involved.\n\nMISSIN' MISTER BUNN: And we need to be prepared for those things. And I think that we will all be at risk. And as you know, in the last week or so we have seen, particularly in Afghanistan, the Taliban or the other groups that are trying to push out of the country so a lot of children are becoming vulnerable and their families are getting hit.\n\nI had a mother who saw her child in Pakistan and knew her little boy, but I didn't hear him and I didn't give him the opportunity to play with me. And I don't know how he got his shot. He had the gun. He was at a gun range. I don't know who fired that.\n\nThis is who is at risk here, the kids of the Columbine School shootings, and I think when you try to think of guns and how our country is doing, I just don't think there's any reason to think that anybody should have a gun. I think that we should be prepared for what we're dealing with. We should be prepared for what happens here in America.\n\nMISSIN' MISTER BUNN: But the first of all, if you watch the news, for example, there's been a new, and this is kind of shocking, it's happening all over the world, that people are being murdered by the Taliban. And there are more and more people dying in this country by the Taliban.\n\nAnd this is not about whether we have enough guns to stop them. It's not about whether we have enough guns for our children in this country. It's not about whether we have enough guns for our children to keep America safe, to help the U.S. become more secure and more prosperous.\n\nMISSIN' MISTER BUNN: I'd like to start off by saying this: I am not worried. We're going to continue to fight. And we are going to have to fight back", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

But it's almost always been a little while since I've seen Game of Thrones in person, whether it be in a TV show or in an episode. It's been some time since I've seen them in person as we were doing our thing!\n\nIn recent years, Theon has had a great life together, which has given the impression that he's always on the move in his dreams!\n\nOh absolutely. He's getting ready to move in with Theon and we're in a big romantic relationship that we didn't even even realize we were living out together! So it's just wonderful to have him in the picture! I've got quite a few friends who were on the Game of Thrones set up, and they all were very much in love with his character. And as a way to communicate that they love him more than anything he plays the part of, it was great to hear they loved the part. We talked about that, of course!\n\nTheon is a big fan of Jon Snow and his family, including his wife (Nora Stark), his younger brother and mother, and they've played a lot of Game of Thrones. So it's no great surprise that the couple have become great friends. It's really all about them.\n\nIt's also been a pleasure having an opportunity to meet them all. Even though you're not really engaged with them (he and Tywin are married, so the relationship is more of a story-based one, but the two get all the love, they're both really strong and I think their marriage is great), you get to see the two characters in their own ways. It's nice to see the two in their real life.\n\nIs there anything that you wanted to say to Brienne of Tarth (a.k.a. 'Sons of Anarchy') that you wanted to ask Brienne to do at the beginning of the episode? And what were some of the challenges and all that she has?\n\nI think she's really wonderful. She's an amazing character. I think she's had a lot of fun growing up and I mean, her parents are dead and people are dying! So I think she knows that there are people on the other side who understand her and they know she knows, and it's just a nice thing to hear her say those. She's got a lot of fun to talk about, so to speak.\n\nWe have three very special guest stars from the episode:\n\nRicardo Torres and Katelyn Cuthbert are going to the set for this show, and they're so awesome! Also, you can check out the episode description for more.\n\nThis episode, which airs Fridays at 10 p.m. EST on HBO, premieres Thursday, March 9 at 10 p.m. on HBO, followed by an episode on The CW on September 24.

{"id": 250230, "text": "- Advertisement -\n\nThe U.S. has made a big splash in the Middle East by joining Iran and Syria as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. According to Foreign Policy, the initiative is a bold move for the United States as it has come to expect support from Russia and China, and has already helped create the perception among some foreign policy-makers that its mission can be accomplished.\n\nIran may be a key component in this new initiative because of its role in the international system, which has increasingly divided and antagonized its neighbors in the region. Even if Iran becomes a non-member (in principle), it could help boost diplomatic ties with Russia, where they have been working since 1979.\n\nSo what will Iran do?\n\nIn short: It says it wants an independent, stateless, and nuclear-free Syria.\n\nRussia is a key player in Syria's conflict, and the Assad government has no qualms about joining the United States. As the BBC puts it:\n\n\"A potential deal with Moscow would be the first step towards securing a lasting peace, despite the ongoing civil war and ongoing conflict with the West. It would also be the first step, after decades of fighting between the Assad regime and Russia, in creating a future government, an independent state and an independent foreign-policy organization. \"If the new Syria has any chance of winning a second vote in this year's U.N. Security Council, it would give the United States a strong voice in the future of the region. Even if it ends up as its own country, its presence would help in building up international support for the Syrian authorities in the fight against terrorism and terrorism in other countries.\"\n\nWhy would Russia want to join Syria?\n\nWith its huge oil reserves and its military budget, Russia is well-known in the Middle East for its influence over both regional and international politics.\n\nBut it also has an appetite for a global power. Russia might help the U.S. defeat ISIS, but that's not what's making Assad one of the more volatile figures in the region. It also says it wants peace, but that's no reason why it would fight ISIS or any other terrorist group in Syria.\n\n\"We have been looking abroad for a way forward for a long time, which is to continue to work towards a negotiated way toward peace,\" Putin told the UN Security Council, according to the Washington Post.\n\nOf course, there's one problem: there's no clear, realistic way to address ISIS in Syria, and all sides seem to agree that, unless and until an authentic solution is found. As the Times reports, \"Russia's top diplomat told the Security Council Wednesday that a new approach for peace negotiations was not possible for the group, saying it could only resolve conflicts after an international political process and the right combination of U.S.-U.K. relations.\"\n\nWhat do Russia's Syrian mission have to say?\n\nRussia's ambassador for Syria, Sergei Ryabkov, says it's not just Syria, but \"the Middle East and other people from all our different regions of the world who want to continue to strengthen this peace process.\"\n\nMoscow might play a bigger role in this new effort than Russia already has. Its \"special representative\" in the U.N. Security Council (Cochrane), Boris Gromyko, spoke out against the current U.S.-backed regime in Damascus earlier this month in an interview with The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.\n\n\"Even though we're supporting you as a representative of the U.N., I don't think anyone in the Security Council is going to listen to you on such issues,\" he told the CIJ.\n\nHe went on:\n\n\"It would be great if you would consider taking action to secure peace for Syria in the framework of a political settlement, just as it was necessary to bring about a peaceful resolution in the Iraq-Syria war. But you know what, I don't want to believe that that would be possible for us as representatives of both nations. We have a political, cultural and economic crisis, and we have to work on all fronts to support all the different perspectives. We cannot go back to pre-1940, a country that was a world power, and we do not want to lose our influence. So, I think it's important for us to think about what we can do in Syria to address this issue head-on.\"\n\nThis approach, in and of itself, isn't a very big deal \u2013 it has some drawbacks, but it's no less damaging than Russian meddling in the 2012 Olympics when Ukraine and Egypt were all involved.\n\nWhat will happen following this initiative?\n\nRussia is already involved in talks with Syria to reach an agreement on a political settlement there, but there have been no progress in reaching this.\n\nThe U.S.-backed regime in Damascus has been a major player in pushing Assad to join the deal, but the U.S", "length": 1024, "ended": false}
{"id": 250231, "text": "\nIn the last couple of days (with my apologies), I've had a very difficult time finding the answer that will make me feel good, at the least about my situation. So I've been doing some searching online for the right answer, and we've found it!\n\nLet me recap:\n\nAt that point I was starting to feel tired, and it made me question why my life mattered to me. I was still in a bad relationship, trying to make an informed decision for myself about not doing anything that really made them want to lose control of their lives.\n\nAt the end of the night, I decided that this time I needed to do something about this, and I didn't.\n\nI was so depressed and upset that I lost it entirely.\n\nMy decision to stop caring about my life really hit me in the face.\n\nWhat I did instead was to sit up and try to figure out what I could do for myself rather than going through what I thought I should have done. If I thought about it enough it could help me decide if I would even look forward to continuing to focus on my life, or if I simply didn't want to think about it anymore.\n\nI took some time off and tried for a week straight after the decision. It just wasn't working out for me. I was too depressed and confused, and didn't think about what I was going to do to make this happen. I didn't get the results I needed from the initial decision. And, while I did end up having a little bit of a hard time staying in touch with my life, I wanted to know why.\n\nI wanted to know that there was something that was important in my life that I had never felt before, and why it was important to get the information and help that I needed right this first time.\n\nI wanted to know that I had been able to live my life, but it has also been a really hard, emotional, and stressful time on my mental and financial journey.\n\nWhen I had decided to stop worrying about the next step I hadn't imagined coming, I had the realization I didn\"t really care much about it for a long time.\n\nBefore I had considered this, I had been pretty sure that I was very depressed, and I had never met anyone who would believe me!\n\nBut that wasn\"t the best of your decision! It must have been one to you that made it such you had to make a change. \"Do you have any suggestions?\"\n\nDo you have any ideas for how to make a change that would make you feel more at ease? (I know that some people get it wrong, and some people get it right.)\n\nWhat I know for sure with this whole thing is that when I look back, I have decided that my life would be a better place if I could move back in, and that's really hard, right?\n\nI didn't lose it though. I didn't completely quit.\n\nI felt much better about myself that night. I didn't suffer from depression. I felt much better about myself, and felt much better about my friends.\n\nI didn't lose the right decision, or any other decision. I really didn't lose the right decision at all.\n\nThe best of that was that, at the end of the day, I had decided that I needed to give this person's life away for their children and children in the future.\n\nSo for one night I finally gave up on this process. I wasn't worried about anything happening \u2013 that would be a lie. I had just given up on getting involved with this life and making some stupid people happy.\n\nThis happened the night before, and I wasn't quite sure if it was something I was going to do. Maybe not, but definitely! How much of a coincidence I was having in my life when I found this information and decided to give some up to not feel like leaving?\n\nWhen I started doing this, I was going to need to take this risk, and maybe do something. Maybe to be able to take responsibility for whatever it took me to do. Maybe to make a decision that would make this my life. I didn't see how this would get any easier, though, and I definitely didn't see how I would feel.\n\nI don't know much about you, but I did a few things to make sure that I didn't end up feeling in the dumps during the first week after my decision.\n\nI'd say that I made a conscious decision about moving forward even though that decision was probably going to be pretty hard; which I probably would've if there were any decisions I had no control over. And, maybe that's just me, but maybe I'm just feeling that way.\n\nSo, I have made this change.\n\nAnd, if you've read my piece about living a healthy and self-accepting adult and living a decent and", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

The first pack I get is 3, so I am happy to have some of my favorite brands of ice cream, all in one box, and I'm happy to be included here in the new flavors and flavors I'm loving right now.\n\nThese were packaged as a gift from my mom in a package, and they were a delight to work with!! I also really love vanilla, so I highly encourage you to try them.\n\nThese ice cream flavors can be made into a treat:\n\nVanilla Ice Cream\n\n\nVanilla Ice Cream\n\nVanilla Ice Cream\n\nVanilla Ice Cream\n\nVanilis Ice Cream\n\n\nIf your using a blender, make sure you get at least one gallon of cold, non-fat milk. If you aren't, try making a single gallon of a cream.\n\nThis was sooooo good:\n\nVanilla Ice Cream\n\nVanilla Ice Cream\n\nVanilla Ice Cream\n\nVanilla Ice Cream\n\nVanilla Ice Cream\n\nHow to Make A Vanilla Ice Cream Recipe? I can give more than one ice cream recipe for you to try and I'd love to hear how you made it, but I feel like it really will give you a flavor boost that will keep you happy and give you a flavor boost (and to me, at least) all year. I hope you guys keep up with my recipes, and I always welcome any new ideas.\n\nIf you want one of my recipes on how to make a Vanilla Ice Cream recipe from any other website you might enjoy the following:\n\nVanilla Ice Cream (V/R) Author: Luscious Vegan Ingredients 2 cups pureed vanilla extract\n\n1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n\n1/2 cup water\n\n1/2 cup water\n\n100 grams dark chocolate chips\n\n1/4 cup coconut oil\n\n1/4 cup brown sugar\n\n1 cup almond milk\n\n15 grams cold unsalted butter 1 oz cold all-purpose flour 8 oz hot cocoa powder\n\n4 cups unsweetened almond milk\n\n1/2 cup water For the frosting, let's make a light chocolate sauce:\n\nIn a mixing bowl combine all remaining ingredients and combine, then whisk together until smooth and creamy, 1/4-inch thick. Cover and chill at least until warm. Chill the ice cream in this case for about an hour, then remove frozen, cooled ice to keep it cold. Allow frozen ice to cool over night or overnight. Remove from warm water and let cool in the refrigerator. Once cooler, add the remaining flour, baking to the bottom and let sit until fully submerged. Let cool to room temperature, as much as possible, then set aside. To make the frosting, melt 5 ounces of vanilla protein powder. Pour into a small bowl, pour the mixture back into the freezer and refrigerate for several hours. If you want to add more chocolate chips, drizzle an additional 1/2 cup of hot chocolate into the ice cream mix and whisk in the remaining protein.\n\n(And, since I love chocolate chips, I just had to cut them in half and then use a knife to cut off one of each)\n\nMakes 2 packages\n\nThis ice cream tastes way better than my regular ice cream.\n\nIt's not like I could be so obsessed with the flavors that my previous one had me over. This one is my go to (this will be the first time I'll ever have it). And I know it will be a difficult process. But I would love to learn about the flavors that make this flavor more and more available every year.

Zika is a potential health risk that must be effectively dealt with.\n\nThe White House issued the National Institutes of Health's June 15 memo outlining whether Zika poses a health risk at a federal level. The NIH director, Dr. Tom Frieden, recommended that spending under $200 million be limited to the most advanced models that were developed that were more likely to be safe. That means the virus would be only capable of penetrating the human body and could take more than a few hours or days to spread.\n\nPresident Trump's administration had previously said that Zika posed no risk to people or other animals, such as babies born to those with microcephaly.\n\nBut Frieden, who directs the NIH, told the Post that the CDC has the \"highest potential\" for infection among pregnant women, and that those who are pregnant should be screened for Zika. That meant screening for Zika early or at all.\n\n\"This is a very real issue, we have a lot of resources available, and if we're going to put out a Zika policy, we need to find that next year,\" Frieden said in an interview with The Associated Press last Friday. \"The federal government needs to be taking a very aggressive position on what they do and how they invest in it and not just the Zika issue.\"\n\nBut the president's statement comes amid strong international concern over Zika. In September, Trump ordered an investigation to help determine how much money it takes to protect Americans against the virus. Some Democrats say more funding should be cut altogether.", "length": 342, "ended": true}

{"id": 250239, "text": "\nWhat exactly is a \"Duke Munchkin\"?\n\nFor one, there's a phrase in the Bible called Dukkha (\"drowning\") that means \"drowning in the sea, when a person is dead.\" This \"drowning\" actually has the form of a small fish with a large head and an unruly throat. There are more words in the Bible (including this one) for the Dukkha than there are Dukkha fish (\"drowning\") for \"drowning\" in the English language, and for the words \"drowning\" and \"drowning's in the sea, drowning in the sea.\" That's why a \"drowning\" is different from \"snaking in the sea.\" An \"Duke Munchkin\" is described as \"a small fish with a big head who is caught in the water, when a person is dead.\" The phrase is \"drowning in the sea, when a person is dead.\"\n\nThe term \"drowning\" comes from Greek: \"Dukkas\" or \"DukeMunchkin\" in Greek means \"drowning in the water, when a person is killed.\" Also, \"DukeMunchkin\" means \"a drowning fish that drowns.\"\n\nDukes in the Bible\n\nFor example, a Duke who was in the company of two young daughters killed by a drunken Duke is called \"Jellyfish\" in Hebrew and also spelled \"kehneh.\"\n\nSee also: Dukes in the Bible.\n\nFor the other name (that may or may not be spelled as \"Gorris\" the Duke of Burgundy of Belgium) this is Gornoth. Also, while the French don't use this word, the French don't use the phrase \"kehneh\" as a term for the Dukkha; the French will use that word when a person is dead in both cases.\n\nThe meaning of the Dukkha can be found in their own words, which also mean Dukkha fish.\n\nDuke Munchkin: The Dukes in the Bible\n\nDukes in the Bible is one of the more memorable passages from the King James Version. The King James Version of King James, which was written in 1604 in England's Chisholm, is in many ways analogous to King James's version in that he changed King James's Dukkha and also changed the name of his daughter, Mee.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the Dukkha also happens to be the key word found in the English version of this one, for the fact that Mee means \"drowning in the water\" (the word means that it swims without drowning the water, a common theme in the English language). In fact, this Dukkha is actually the only English word that does not occur to the King James version.\n\nThis, of course, means that in the English language, Dukkha \"fish\" is not a word with English counterpart. But while there are a lot of English adjectives for \"drowning\" and \"drowning's in the sea,\" the Dukkha are not, according to John the Baptist, to be used in English or Hebrew in the English translation of this one.\n\nFor the rest of the King James translation, the English word for \"drowning\" in the English language is \"fish.\"\n\nThe English Dukkha translation (English translated into English by an English translator) is similar, but in some ways different, than the King James version. As the English version of \"drowning\" in the English English language translates as \"Duke munchkin,\" some Dukkhas who are killed, for example, are called \"Duke munchkin.\"\n\nSee also: Dictionary of Biblical Dukkha Meaning.\n\nIn other words, Dukkha could be pronounced with either \"drowning\" and \"fish,\" in the English translation of this one, or \"fish in the sea.\"\n\nOther Dukkha Translation Related Words", "length": 869, "ended": true}
{"id": 250240, "text": "I'm not sure what the purpose of \"conclusions\" are, but it seems there are some fairly solid arguments that this is an obvious mistake that needs to be corrected. For example, the following is an example of a \"questionable use\" argument: \"Is that a use of the term \"nope\"? What do I mean when I say that it's a use? (The first paragraph of the sentence was taken from a questionable use example on the subject of the word \"nope: no) In that case, there is no such objection. The first clause is just that, the clause that makes it sound as if it's a use. It might be a different one, but I'm not sure what it's going to do to the standard issue, and it may well be a different question that I was not sure of yet. I would therefore conclude that this is \"nope\" (i.e., not something that's been used for decades; see the quote above about this question).\"\n\nThis is not to say that we should always reject \"nonsense\" if it is made up, as in the case of this particular case:\n\nAn idea like this would seem to have some merit, since the use of the word \"nope\" is, in many ways, an insult to women because it's such an easy term to use. People who are sexually attracted to someone are clearly not attracted to anyone sexually. That's exactly what a feminist person would say if they found the word \"nope\" offensive. But to think that this is the way it is when the word has been used in the context of a rape culture is ridiculous. This is the very point of discussion.\n\nAn additional point on this is that the fact that feminism advocates for \"convergence\" within and without the context of \"nope\" might mean that she's not trying to prove either that it wasn't a rape culture issue, or that she's saying that \"convergence\" has nothing to do with it, since the context that says that it actually is is so ambiguous from \"sexually aggressive\" to \"unsexualized,\" and so that feminism is arguing for this.\n\nI think the way the issue is understood is this:\n\nIn other words, feminism has always promoted, and is actively promoting, that sex that occurs between individuals is \"fool's gold.\" A woman cannot be a slut if she doesn't have any sort of relationship with other individuals. (Note: I'm not arguing otherwise. One would never assume the very low \"fool's gold,\" in fact.) We all know that the \"convergence\" element in sex is very weak because, after all, it's all about how we deal with individuals. So while this argument might seem to suggest that \"nope\" and \"convergence\" are not important, those terms may be very weak and are not important to feminists if they are used as a way to attack rape. So feminism is fighting back against this false accusation in the first place by pushing for more \"convergence\" within the context of sex between a woman and a man. The more \"convergent\", and the more we're talking about actual situations involving real people, the better we can do when we're talking about \"convergence.\" There is so much wrong with this argument.\n\nThere is more.\n\nI know some that would take the view that it is okay to be sexually impure, because \"toxic masculinity\" is so toxic (which is more of an idea than a fact on the part of Feminism, and which I want to argue at length as well). This is really all the way with women, in which the real problem is that they are so easily \"feralized\" by the word themselves.\n\nThat said, this is not the wrong debate to be having.\n\nI'll return to this post more after I have more concrete information.\n\nWhen I'm writing, I often use the term \"nonsense\" for my own reasons, but in terms of general conversation, I tend to use the term to refer to a certain kind of thought, based on a particular notion of the term that exists. But I'm not saying these things are bad, because there is nothing bad about my idea of \"nonsense\"\u2014it's just that I think they're just fine.\n\nSome other good ones:\n\nThe idea that if I use the word \"nope,\" there has actually been a very limited number of rapes to date. There are more than 300 rapes (and I know many others) documented under the name in the data from California and the District of Columbia, and the problem is that many cases have been reported from far away.\n\nThe idea that \"nope\" sounds like an insult to women because it's such an easy to confuse word to sound. The most successful \"nonsense use\" is often about sex between men, where there is no real", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

I didn't want to be homeless, I didn't want to be in poverty, and I wasn't prepared to give up,\" Rodman Sr. told The Chronicle in August 2011.\n\nRodman Sr. and his girlfriend, Kristi, were living in an apartment in the 50 block of South Third Avenue. Rodman Sr.'s father, Rodman himself, had always planned on going to college and attending the University of Colorado Boulder over a minimum of four years. But he also felt the need to run for president of the United States.\n\nHe was determined to do it. In fact, he had bought a penthouse and apartment for his mom and stepfather. But he was desperate because his life had already taken a turn for the worse since that day, and he couldn't come up with an alternative way to live.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before Dennis Rodman Sr. and other homeless men like him would start coming to the city. They'd say, \"Hey, I'm a member of the Salvation Army. I love cooking,\" or \"Hey I gotta eat this for my family,\" or \"I need some money. Can we get you some food?\"\n\nBut their words were a rousing success. The city of Boulder, Boulder's capital. But even then, the homeless men were also coming back to life. Rodman Sr. knew that his dream was a success and he would have to face it.\n\nCatherine Schafer, an executive at the Boulder Downtown Partnership, which was started by the homeless and the homeless men, said the men have had great success as long as there has been government intervention.\n\n\"It's been amazing to see the growth and to be so vocal,\" Schafer said. \"The homeless have actually been taking us to places where people don't care about us. In order to make sure no one else is taken to a place like that, we have been really concerned with providing housing on a large scale for more people.\"\n\nThat was when a group of men went up to B.C.'s homeless shelter and spoke to people. One of the men asked why they had come for a meal before he or she became homeless. One of the men told the homeless they wanted shelter.\n\nWhile the men talked to the homeless men, others came to the shelter, including a woman wearing an anti-homeless t-shirt and carrying plastic bags with messages like, \"All children are children,\" and \"Don't get me started on homelessness. In your eyes, no matter how you talk to your fellow citizens, life is too short.

I hope you agree this has left me, in many aspects of my work, looking much better each year.\nWith the game being available for purchase as a single player with Steam, we are looking to support a game where players will be able to play an exciting sandbox game to build a home in the world of Minecraft. There have been some games which have tried and failed to achieve the right balance of fun and challenge while still offering plenty of gameplay. Some success in this respect alone could have been expected, particularly in the beginning of this year for me. The new update brings several new weapons, items and abilities and will bring to mind a more balanced, cooperative gameplay experience along with a host of new classes and abilities.\nThe first half of August sees the release of the first of the expansion series, the Black Isle. The new island will be divided into a three story islands. Both the Black Isle and the original Black Isle are now free to explore, and in many respects, both will be completely free from the restrictions imposed by the map pack. The challenge presented by the map pack is that the islands are large and feature a wide variety of natural wonders and unique environments all looking to provide a challenge to new players alike. A lot of content will also be added, including character quests, crafting, crafting recipes and more.\nWe are in the process of putting together a roadmap for the expansion and there are areas of content which have yet to be completed. The last time the expansion was featured at SXSW we posted an article where we suggested that developers who wanted to continue exploring the island system should consider making it accessible to new players. It seems a bit dated to announce such open, open and open-ended development where developers can choose their work from as needed. At this stage however, we will update you with the latest information about each project. As with the last project, there have been some recent improvements in the progress of the development. I really have come a long way from the beta period when we decided to have a beta. I'm confident we will be able to provide our feedback towards these games and hopefully I will have the opportunity to be more active in the development process during the new year.\nI will be continuing my development work in the coming months and will try to work with a few developers to produce a game that you'll love to play and enjoy.\nIf you have something you'd like to see me do on my website, message me. I'd love to hear from you and have more fun creating your own content. I've got plenty of ideas for you to submit as part of any project and please leave them in the comments below.

The resolution would allow an appeals court to \"reconsider the proposed legislation as soon as possible.\" The measure was sponsored by Sen.

{"id": 250256, "text": "A \"Degree of Succession\" is a term coined by John Steinbeck. In the book, Steinbeck defined a degree of success by defining the degree to which a person's achievements were considered to be worthy of reward for achieving them. \"Equal\" in Steinbeck's terminology was a term used to refer to an amount of money that a recipient (or \"man\" in Steinbeck's day) was able to get for the purpose of rewarding his or her accomplishments. Succession refers to the ability to make money at the price of achieving the goal. Success does not necessarily mean being successful at something. The degree of success a person achieves does not imply that the degree to which the person's achievement was rewarded at the time of the achievement. To be known, a person's achievement is worthy of reward if it was achieved in a very high degree of accomplishment or if it was achieved to the maximum. However, there are times when the person's accomplishments do not necessarily translate to achieving higher incomes or more desirable features in life without that person being compensated for their achievements by those earnings. Successful individuals, if they did not achieve a standard of success, can be defined as those who achieved at, well above the level a standard of success for which he or she has earned the necessary rewards. Therefore, one could say he or she would have earned more if they had had a successful career. For a successful individual, achieving a higher degree of success and gaining a higher degree of money does not necessarily mean success. One has to look at his or her achievements, his or her achievements, their money, his or her success, his or her achievements, how strong you can make them be in any particular situation and what level of accomplishment they should have. This is a topic which I shall attempt to address shortly. A high degree or success means a level of achievement on the high end or high on the quality of someone's life which is worthy of reward to that person. In addition, as a result of getting a lower degree of success a person's ability to live an optimal life is better than that of that person living a high level of personal fulfillment and prosperity in life is better than that of that person living in a high level of fulfillment and prosperity in life or even being part of the elite of other people in society.\nIn order to understand how it is that those high levels of success are best expressed it is necessary to review the three categories of higher achievement and a category of higher failure and one of those is the degree. Although the degree is the percentage of a person's achievement with high levels of a person's income or wealth that he or she earned in his or her career, it is not something that is simply measured or defined by their total income. In his or her career he or she achieved a high level of income and it was earned by him or her on a weekly basis. However, it did not include their income, wealth, or other assets that included those investments that were not made up of his or her own personal savings or savings accounts. Most importantly, most successful individuals only received their degrees at a certain level. In other words, they could not claim those degrees in a way that made them the only able and able to achieve a higher degree based on their achievements.\nSuccessful individuals, on the other hand, earned their degrees to be successful in a meaningful way within their careers. The degree is a percentage of a person's earning. A successful man or woman has a higher degree than one would expect at the same earnings level where the person who earned the higher degree earned much less. In fact, higher degree earnings are almost always the result of a person giving up the pursuit of the greater good. While a certain person may get a lower degree than if he or she had already been at the highest level within his or her career to have earned a higher degree, once a person has reached the higher degrees he or she will likely be able to keep up, or maybe at times will make up a significant amount or increase his or her income and wealth. If, however, he or she gets an additional degree to which he or she did not earn much at the same level as the previous degree earned, he or she may find it difficult to have more success with that degree. Thus when a person's achievement is higher, the success may not always translate to higher earning levels given a lower degree. Furthermore, if the completion of his or her degree does not translate to his or her earning ability which is what is most important to achieving the higher degree, it may not translate at all. If one looks closely at the higher degrees one must realize that they are not always higher because they are not achieved at the same rate.\nOnce again, because the degree does not define what an individual's future might be, the exact number of degrees is not a definite measure because the degree is a function of the person's personal success as well as by his or her achievements that the person is able to create. However, because of the degree and its role", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

If you've ever read my work, or if you've ever experienced something like this, I'd like to remind you that this is a short story from my book titled The Art Of Writing, which came out in 2013.\n\nThe piece started with the story of an innocent, non-violent woman, my daughter, who was kidnapped and taken to an orphanage, where her mother's spirit was sent via magic to the world around her. All this time, her parents had been busy helping her and her sister survive a dangerous situation, but the real life of a child raised and cared by a non-violent woman with a magical body.\n\nIt turns out that a magical girl named Yuriko, who had come in contact with the spirit of her adoptive father, had somehow got herself transported to life in the body of an orphanage in Tokyo.\n\nI was at a friend's birthday party and he asked me if I had some ideas for story-crafting. I thought about building a story for a future that doesn't involve children and characters. He wanted to see what type of magic it was possible to create for a story of her real life, though, so I made up my own story. It's called My Story.\n\n\"The next part was when someone who is a little girl came to America, who was in her early twenties. She was a girl from Japan, and you could imagine her parents are very friendly. And she was very friendly. If I told her that she had come to Japan, and she was an American girl, she would think, 'What, you got to go with that!' And we knew there would be a lot of support and people would be very interested. So the first lesson that we learned was, 'Look at this! It's so kind!' \"\n\nOn the story's opening act, her father tells her that Yuriko is from Japan, and we learn the following about our time in America:\n\n\"I met the Japanese girl and was introduced to her, which is one of the things about Japanese, Japan is unique. And that one character she mentioned is actually a very unusual person. She is like a woman's little girl,\" she explains. \"She's about 11, and when you walk in front of her, there's not one thing you can feel. You never have to touch her. Every time you try to look her in the eye, there's always something that moves her.\"\n\nThe story has plenty of action, including a moment of her father telling the story of one of three men who were abducted. In all three cases, they were American teens, but Yuri comes from an orphanaged home on Japan's southern coast. She is brought to Europe to learn about Magic, and it works like magic for her: she's given a place in Magic World on Earth while people from Japan are sent to the orphanage, which they later meet and befriend with other Americans. This is Yuri's first time being sent on her own to an orphanage.\n\n\"So I was trying to think of an episode I would like to tell,\" Yuri explains. \"This is this weird girl that's coming in to America and she has come from America trying to join this world of magic and human magic. How would Japan be understanding of her? They're kind of, like, 'This is how we would like to bring back this girl,' 'The world is full of people coming in to support her, because there are so many ways of bringing this world into this place. Like, if you're coming into this world with magic, don't worry. It can work!\"\n\nYuri has a dream and it starts with a conversation with my father. He wants us to give him some Magic Girl things. What he has been doing with the Magical girl is like this. But he isn't as interested in his magic as he is in bringing back the world to him and this is my dream. And that dream is that if I don't have a magical girl like Yuri, he'd be so angry that he'd destroy it. Then he'd have to do something, like tell his friends of his experience by saying to them \"You are the one who lost your life and you didn't really live it, you must do things right now for this to happen.\" Then his friends would be like, \"You need to give this a try. You must work. You just have to be really careful. The more you give it the more powerful you become.\"\n\nBut as he looks to see if there is anyone in America with the power to bring back the world, one person's love for that magic girl disappears. The magical girl is brought back to this world.\n\nThe plot of my book doesn't start there either.

However, in most of these cities, they do so in tandem with the laws banning the possession of guns under California law, which is now in place. Because that is the new way of distributing guns and the state is going to legalize guns for recreational use. In short, the local laws don't even apply to the school that makes up a particular school, and you can't do that over and over again.\n\nIt's not like, \"Oh!

{"id": 250266, "text": "\nBy Robert L. Brown\n\nOn Wednesday January 10th, 2014, the U.S. Naval Academy awarded the first ever international \"Pilot Test in an Air Force aircraft\" to The F-35 Joint Space Systems (JJSS) program.\n\nA week later the U.S. and its partners successfully flew test flights of the fighter jet as part of the A-10 program. As a result of that successful test mission the U.S. and our partners in Russia and Europe joined forces in a series of tests that will now begin in March on an A-10 Joint Spaceport.\n\nThe following article will explain how the test is expected to be performed and demonstrate its effectiveness on the A-10A. Additionally, I will briefly outline the testing and how successful the test was.\n\nA-10 JSCS Test\n\nThe first step on the way to the landing is selecting the launch vehicle for airframe test in an Air Force aircraft test (AGT). The Air Force has had several training missions to develop and design the aircraft for the A-10 mission. The Air Force has designed the A10 and was also involved in designing and making the F-35 Joint Space Systems. In addition, the Joint Space Systems includes a launch control system for its Joint Strike Fighter (JSFS), and the TIE fighter system that can fire a guided missile-capable missile.\n\nEach test will include a specific launch of the aircraft by both USAF and Navy test programs with a specific mission on view. Testing on both the A-10 and the HFS is being conducted in an attempt to produce a flight time estimate in the A-10. In order to determine the flight schedule for each type test, Air Force test teams will be present in an Air Force field office at the end of the day that will review and prepare a \"specification file.\" I believe the flight schedule will give those who participate a better chance to understand the flight schedule in advance.\n\nFirst Steps\n\nIt appears that the airframe test for the new A-10 Joint Spaceport on March 12, 2014 is due to airframe test. This test is to evaluate the performance of the A-10 and JSCS.\n\nFirst, an updated version of the A-10 launch mission schedule is prepared to be used to determine the flight schedule for the A-10.\n\nA-10 JSCS Landing Test\n\nThe airframe test for the A-10 mission is to evaluate the performance of the A-20 Joint Space System. As the test has progressed in the past, the first flight was performed against an A-10.\n\nA-10 JSS Fitting Test\n\nAs part of the initial pilot testing, both the A-10 and JSCS landed on a surface of a target. The JSCS, which is an A-30 and runs on a Lockheed Vulcan, is positioned on a hilltop of high elevation and an FBO is on deck for a landing attempt.\n\nAll three teams used a combination of both airframe and fighter test vehicles. The A-10 landed on an altitude of 15,000 feet for both ground and air. Airframe test vehicles utilized a high-pressure airbag, as well as an A/G-19 and T-10C airbag. The flight test vehicle was the airbag that was installed in each team and weighed less than 7 lbs, which was the difference between a full-scale or a lightweight F-35.\n\nIf the A-10 landed on a target on the ground it should be noted that it is unlikely there will be a large fire to occur and there will also be some debris from the aircraft's landing or landing operations as a result of the debris.\n\nThe landing on a target could cause significant impacts to the A-10 or also the aircraft. Depending on this area of concern, both teams may choose to target the target or attempt to attack it. The A-40 Joint Strike Fighter (JSFS) is the most likely target and will require heavy ground force to accomplish landing. This test target may require a high-speed F-35 air strike on ground.\n\nThe A-10 landed on 5,000 feet elevation for both ground and air. It was the most likely target and it will require a heavy ground force to accomplish landing. It will need to have an A-20 crewman, a small crewman and a small vehicle to do ground work. As the aircraft were on top of each other it would not require any additional ground support as it would be more likely to land on the ground instead of in a nearby area.\n\nThe JSS Fitting Test was used to evaluate and validate the JSCS performance. The F-35 has been tested many times as it is a F/A-18E/F Super Hornet that is being built for the U.S. Air Force and is used by the U.S. Army and Marine Corps", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

Many people assume you're an evil monster of color, or, perhaps, an enemy of white people. It may seem irrational to assume, but it's not the only thing you can be racists about. If you're trying to figure out whether or not you're a good human being or not, you might want to take a look at the research on this subject.\n\nThe researchers studied 3,531 racial groups from various educational institutions in Maryland. They found that black Americans had higher self-esteem, lower levels of self-esteem, less self-confidence, more self-esteem, higher levels of narcissism, and higher feelings of social inferiority and inferiority to black people in their twenties and thirties. They also found that white Americans had greater self-esteem. But these differences weren't statistically significant, meaning that there wasn't a measurable correlation between these groups, but rather their own self-identity, that makes them different from any other group.\n\nIn their study, the researchers followed college students for five years on either their college or university campuses for a few years. \"These were the kinds of studies of which the academic literature says most people do not read,\" says Chris Ault in the Washington Post. It turns out, that a study out in 2014 that looked at college students was actually a better place to study, because its writers didn't need to be college-educated to understand that a college degree was a valuable resource.\n\nIn this study, both undergraduate undergraduates and non-athletes were shown pictures and stories they had heard before while they were on campus. The researchers found that the white undergraduates had more narcissism compared to the black or Hispanic peers, when compared to the non-athletes themselves.\n\nSome people think narcissism refers to things like how one self-doubts oneself, when one doesn't know what's going on in the world, or how he/she feels around others\u2014which makes people more likely to self-critique another race than people who don't believe themselves. But in this study, the researchers decided to test this hypothesis using the same question of narcissism and other forms of self-doubting.\n\nThey decided to study only the ones to whom they'd known each other for five years, so they only studied people who'd had relationships with each other for 10 years or more, that's how they could compare them when they were looking at their students.\n\nThe study looked at four groups of students, including those who knew each other for five years, and those who hadn't known each other for five years, and those who didn't know each other for five years. \"That set off a long tail, including students who had been friends or acquaintances of the other students for five years or more,\" Ault says.\n\nThen, Ault compared these four groups, looking at their narcissism when looking at different group identities, from white to black, and all of the results were statistically significant. \"For the white group, who are much more likely to self-doubt and have a harder time accepting negative feedback, the effect was that the black group's narcissism was higher than that of the white group's,\" Ault says.\n\nA second major reason for the differences is that a group of white kids who're at a higher social level in school are not as likely to self-critique themselves as the black kids. \"The black kids are more likely than the white kids to be really upset because they're more willing to say something negative and then have it hurt the other three kids. What's nice is that we know we can control and measure this.\"\n\nAs much as this is a research issue, Ault says there's still much to learn about how these groups of black adolescents can change how we view and treat each other. \"It won't just end up being racism or something we don't like, but that people can have a much more realized relationship with and see how they relate to themselves, and the difference is so big.\"", "length": 851, "ended": true}
{"id": 250273, "text": "\n(CNN) A federal judge has ordered Oklahoma to stop using marijuana on its children's property and give a license to the state's medical marijuana system, officials said on Friday.\n\nA U.S. District Court judge in Oklahoma declined a request to issue a preliminary injunction forcing the city to halt selling marijuana through July 30. The court is now moving forward on whether to hear a lawsuit by the school districts.\n\nThe judge ruled last June that Oklahoma's medical marijuana law has enough safeguards to prevent the program from becoming illegal and allow the state to collect revenues from growers, sellers and dispensaries.\n\nAs of last August, the state government, led by Gov. Mary Fallin, had received only $10 million in cash in the form of medical marijuana, according to a state Department of Health and Human Services filing.\n\nBut that figure was down substantially from its previous level in January 2012, and the state agreed to fund the program as of August 20, when it had received payments, which is the third day since a federal injunction was entered.\n\nThe court filing is the second-largest ruling to seek $10 million in damages from the medical marijuana program since U.S. District Judge David K. Moore's June 30 ruling was published on the city of Oklahoma's website.\n\nMoore said on his blog post that the state had not been forthcoming with the federal settlement it has secured from the federal government that states have made to recover the money, or the money had been stolen from businesses and property owned by them and taken into custody.\n\nThe court granted the city of Oklahoma $10 million Tuesday in return for providing the state with $13 million in debt relief and an $11 million fine, he said in his original ruling.\n\nThe agreement would let city officials, employees and vendors maintain their existing legal rights to medical marijuana after it comes into effect, the court said.\n\nWhile the new legal arrangement allows the state to purchase recreational marijuana from an individual as long as the state doesn't sell it through marijuana stores, Kephart ruled that the state cannot sell marijuana for a controlled substance without a license and required the state to get authorization from the attorney general.\n\nIn his order, Judge Moore ruled that state and nonprofit groups need not apply to get permission from Kephart to sell medical marijuana from a non-profit entity. But, he ruled that those groups are able to \"do that if they want,\" that's what the state may and may not do.\n\nKephart found that \"the legislature has never properly understood that the right to possess, distribute, and sell marijuana is of fundamental importance to the state as well as the public, or will be necessary to assure its public health.\" He also found that the Legislature should be able to change its mind on medical marijuana.\n\nKephart also wrote that if the state allows any of the non-profit groups to acquire marijuana and sell it for commercial purposes, it could provide the state with a license to process the proceeds of the sale. Kephart found that \"there is at least a basic possibility of government interference with the purchase of medical marijuana\" by the non-profit groups, and that \"it is necessary\" that a state or state entity not allow any of the non-profit groups to do so.\n\n\"It is true that the state has jurisdiction over the business transactions of the non-profit organizations and that the individual marijuana sales by these non-profits are lawful and are regulated by the Oklahoma State Liquor Control Commission as required by statute,\" the judge wrote. \"The State would not permit a state entity to engage in medical marijuana use if it did not intend to use such the products as a method of regulating medical marijuana in the States.\"\n\nUnder Oklahoma law, marijuana and alcohol are not controlled substances at all, but alcohol and marijuana are. Kephart ruled that if a non-profit organization wants to sell alcohol or marijuana for recreational use -- like medical marijuana, although not regulated by the state -- the state must present the state with proof it is not selling it illegally.\n\n\"Because of this ruling, if the state were not required to obtain permission from the attorney general to transfer the controlled substance from one private owner to another, the legislature cannot allow such a transfer to a business,\" the judge wrote.\n\nThe state is expected to meet with Oklahoma voters Tuesday afternoon to pass a budget. On Friday, Republican Gov. Mary Fallin has said she wants to allow non-profit organizations like the Oklahoma Board of Commissioners for Medical Cannabis (OPCCM) to sell medical marijuana for recreational use, because they would help alleviate some of the burden of regulating marijuana use.\n\nRead More", "length": 957, "ended": true}

{"id": 250276, "text": "\n(Image: Wikimedia Commons)\n\nWe've all heard of the 'golden age' of 'unbiased' data analysis that allows authors to find and then apply the best estimates they can about subjects' preferences and attitudes. But there's nothing wrong with trying different methods. Even when you're doing it at a high level \u2013 for example using individual data to build a detailed report of every patient or their family history or disease \u2013 it's useful to try to find and compare outcomes over time, rather than blindly following a series of narrow 'golden ages' every time a particular data set is released.\n\nBut you may find that some data that hasn't been released \u2013 or hasn't made it into print before \u2013 is much more useful and potentially helpful.\n\nA key example is age group analysis. An analysis of age groups by researchers at New York University and the University of Maryland found that the overall age structure of medical data was roughly similar to that of their control data in many developed countries. But the data was also vastly different from the control data because it was not used to measure any specific disease as a whole, and the analysis didn't look at an entire group of patients, rather at only individuals using a particular medical condition, which is a tricky task because there are so few controls over disease and some can be identified even if they live in one or two different countries. There are also few controls over the quality of information to use, or whether they are healthy or otherwise.\n\nIn practice, this means that a large number of doctors could get very wrong about a particular subject's health or lifestyle preferences. So you could write a whole series of papers, but not one about a particular person or condition and still find some benefit. The data and treatment it found could, in itself, still be used to make more informed decisions about an individual's health or medical conditions. And as Dr. David S. Sacks recently pointed out, this is no accident \u2013 it's a useful mechanism for understanding the general trend in medical opinion in the health sciences, and the effect it has has changed for patients looking for information that may not exist in the controlled clinical setting.\n\nOther studies, however, have shown otherwise \u2026\n\nFor example, the American College of Sports Medicine published an extensive literature review in 2004 called The 'Study on Ageing. The analysis of weight changes by age was largely flawed. In general, the analysis found no relation between mean weights and lifetime weight change, and not a significant relationship between mean weight changes and other characteristics of the individual (p < 0.01) \u2026 the evidence from these studies is consistent with those from the BMJ.\n\nYet another systematic review of the literature is published recently by a panel of doctors. It finds that the results don't add up, for example, to a clear correlation between the average lifespan and mortality. The researchers also don't even see a link between any different diseases and their causes and their treatments, instead referring their studies to different, longer periods of time as shown in Figure 1. This isn't an artifact of how they've looked at some disease categories, as there were no significant associations, but rather one with all other diseases.\n\nWhen looking at some longer periods of time as an indicator of what the health of the patient has meant to him or her over the years, however, they also use different methods to figure out the relationship between those longer periods of time and their outcomes. For example, the American College of Sports Medicine used a data set called the MEDLINE trial to examine the effect of smoking cessation on lifetime physical activity (BMI). The authors found significant associations between those longer than 60 years and physical activity and health outcomes including death.\n\nAs with all medical data sources, it may not be all sunshine and rain, of course, but it's nice to see some good news for a trend that's always been one of the main driving forces behind the debate over how to make health care better for everyday people.\n\nIf you've been following the news about health care in the early 2000s, congratulations! The media is starting to understand the significance of our current high prevalence of obesity in the U.S. \u2013 and that obesity plays a big role too. The New York Times published an interesting article about health risks associated with the obesity epidemic in the late 1970s \u2013 and the Times was particularly thorough with its coverage of the problems that obesity affects, which includes a lot of the same issues as the obesity epidemic.\n\nBut there's a big exception where we haven't really started to see much of a change in attitudes about obesity. The latest research by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases suggests a large shift has taken place in how we see our obesity, which is in turn changing in many other ways too \u2013 including how we assess and understand obesity in the real world.\n\nA 2011 National Geographic article highlighted this trend by looking at two of the most notable public health studies about obesity in recent years: the one from the British and Canadian", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

But the company had one year to figure out a way to improve its image. While it continues to operate with aggressive price-setting, CEO Randall Stephenson recently wrote in a WSJ op-ed that the stock is \"still not a good fit for us. We also need to keep our brand intact and continue delivering results and shareholder value.\" The company's current stock price is a bit different now than it was in 2007 after the firm's share price exploded from $47.68 per share to $71.37 per share, meaning that the company, under its chairman and chief executive, has to have the same level of capital as its peers. The current stock price is well below the $74.50 per share price of the company it was founded in 2007. While Apple is a major shareholder in the company, the company is still a relatively small investment in a company that doesn't have much in the way of cash.

But this year it was back in the $2,000 range and a bit up a notch in volume, thanks primarily to an upgrade in Internet service from a new wireless service, and the stock is on the upswing. But when stock prices go up, it takes a big hit that can hurt Comcast's bottom line. This year, the stock's stock price has soared 21%. And that's because of an increase in competition. Comcast's stock is up 32% in the last six months. Comcast has a long history of growing its brands and is more than willing to invest if it can get its products in part of the country or in parts of the world. But the company has had to increase its spending in certain markets to keep growing well in the future.\n\nMitch McConnell: McConnell (R-Ky.) ran for reelection on a platform that would have put him in the Senate for a decade or even six years.

Whitehead, Ph.D., gives a detailed description of a 'biblical' version. In a passage for the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Whitehead writes,\n\nIn the Old Testament God has been portrayed as impenetrable, so that he would be difficult to kill. In our Gospel story, he has been taken up by the devil. His face is white and gray and the shape of his head is grey. . . .\"\n\nIn this sense, the New Testament tells the story of a man who fights demons in an attempt to destroy his kingdom.\n\nBut it also gives insight into the doctrine of the Law and the moral authority, the basis upon which it was practiced. In a chapter for the Twelve Apostles, he writes, \"We shall not let others stand by you. God must go upon and save the wicked from his wrath. I do not expect him to let you stand by me at all.\"\n\nWhen the Lord sent missionaries to the Old World, they found that the Old World had some laws against the people, and that Christians and non-Christians were treated to be 'in hell' and treated as 'inanimate.' It was not their God that could cause that, but God.\n\nThe Law was that people who had not been given it by Christ were not condemned, and there was no God before. It was their Lord (Ezekiel 37:1-12) that was 'in hell' for it was the 'God in heaven,' and they were all condemned to hell. There were no other people before him who knew the Law by the 'faith of the flesh.' It is not the case that God did not take all believers (Matt. 24:22, 23). No one who knew the Law was made to go through hell.\n\nThe question which can thus be raised is why did so many members (and, for that matter, a large number of those already in heaven) fall into such disfiguration? The answer is simple. The Law is for all people to obey, and by this we mean everyone who is not in the New Testament, who is not in the other Old Testament, who is not in the other New Testament, who is not who the New Testament claims as 'inhabitants.'\n\nIn this view, the Old Testament claims some 'inhabitants,' as the Bible does, but it does not prove their true nature.\n\nNowadays, the Church has no 'inhabitants.' As stated above, the people who are in the other New Testament are those who have already done the 'inhabitancy' that the Law is designed to prevent.\n\nThe doctrine of 'inhabitance' in the New Testament is the doctrine that we have to take one person and not another, and that we must all go back if not all the others and each one have died, so to speak.\n\nIt is no different in that the Law is in every nation, and even in the Bible. The Law of God is to bring everyone to a place of refuge which is the home of the Father and the Son and Christ. It is the Law of love and peace for every person. It is the Law of the Lord (Matt. 27:2-9).\n\nIt is the Law of those that have been put to death, for it is the Law of the Lord (John 12:4).\n\nThe Law was for that which was, and is our Law. But not all people fell into hell, and no one has been put to death that God may not judge for us or for the kingdom of God.\n\nAs this verse of our gospel reveals, we have made the law, God has taken it up. In the New Testament it takes a different form. We have given the law to the people (see Gal. 2:9-11), and we have made a law of love, peace, justice, and the law of our Heavenly Father.\n\nIn that sense, there is no difference for us about what we have done or have not done.\n\nSo why do we think that this is so with regard to Jesus and his followers (see John 14:35, 38, 43, 42-43)?\n\nBecause it's true that the Lord has established that every person must be treated as an ancestor of those of the Church who have been put to death or saved. If that's the case, then why does that rule apply to us, that we may then be treated as the descendants of any person who had not been 'in some way given' and thus, when they were taken up as martyrs", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

But Trump, of course, did not stop with the announcement.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday that he wanted to \"talk about our health care law now\" and to \"go about our businesses and focus on our economy\" to make sure that people's health care is getting better as fast as possible.\n\nThe White House said Trump did not talk about the Affordable Care Act's fate and that while no final fix would be found, there was the idea of rolling it back to the individual mandate. But it said that when that process is over it could be a possible option that could save lives.\n\nRepublicans in Congress hope Trump will show them he understands the system and will have the flexibility to make it work.\n\nIn his remarks Wednesday, Speaker Ryan called the plan that Trump said were in place on HealthCare.gov a \"very reasonable thing,\" noting that the bill is just another part of his broader health-care overhaul, which he said will \"bring us all together.\" \"That will continue to strengthen the American health insurance system, expand access to affordable care and help people be able to buy in a much more affordable environment,\" Ryan added.\n\nBut even the president's critics say those changes are far from being realistic. A study released by the Kaiser Family Foundation this week found that the law's success rate was even worse in the months when the law was in existence than in the months of the individual mandate.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of law enforcement data found that while it has the same level of enforcement as the health-care law, the number of uninsured increased significantly from September 2014 to November 2015, when it was in operation. The Kaiser analysis also found that during the year that the law was there, the number of adults age 65 and older without coverage dropped in six of the 11 key categories: working, unmarried and separated, in which age groups were most at risk. The Kaiser study said the change was mostly due to the law's expansion of Medicaid and the increase in federal funding for mental health services.\n\nBut it's also true that the law actually increased the number of uninsured at the same time it increased the number of uninsured at a much further increase. As the study notes:\n\nOver this period, both enrollment in and spending on mental health services decreased.\n\nThe number of adults age 65 and older with mental health problems decreased from August 2013 to September 2015, although some of those patients were more likely than others to lose their coverage.\n\nDuring this period, it became clear that more and more people, particularly young people, who experienced lower incomes and lower health care spending, would be left with no alternative.\n\nWhile the law made a big difference to reducing enrollment among such individuals, a number of experts questioned whether that effect can be reversed.\n\n\"We really can't know the ultimate effects, or whether there could be a full reverse, but it's obviously extremely difficult to know,\" said Michael T. White, executive director of the National Association of Chiefs of Police in Virginia.\n\nBut even if the law's effects don't reverse, it's not just taking the law away altogether: it's affecting some people's ability to obtain health care.\n\n\"It's not just going away, it's going through change,\" said Jessica R. Williams, president of the advocacy group New America Foundation.\n\nWilliams said that during the year that the law was in full effect, more than 6 million fewer children under the age of 12 were receiving care than their counterparts in 2009. She and other experts think that more parents, particularly those who may be struggling with child care, are likely benefiting if the law is enacted.\n\n\"We think that if the law is applied fully to that population \u2014 even those children who are probably struggling with an illness, or not getting it, then the policy would be very much in its favor,\" said Williams.\n\nShe said if the law were to pass in part so that young people could become fully insured and be able to access care, it would ultimately", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

It has strained efforts by allies, including Russia and Turkey, to bring a U.S. alliance in the region closer to the Syrian border and help the U.S. fight Islamic State. Source: Syria Campaign for Truth\n\nThe United States has been in contact with the Syrian government in recent weeks. The administration is still trying to assess what role the Obama administration may have played in supporting the Syrian state to win back the areas where militants seized control, but the administration's recent response \u2014 and how the administration would respond \u2014 would likely be a useful tool to push the Assad government back.\n\nThe United States is also trying its European allies to help with the fight against Islamic State, as one senior U.S. official told The New York Times.\n\n\"The U.S. and NATO are now working toward some sort of a more comprehensive alliance, though I think they are not ready to go that far,\" said Douglas Feith, director of the Institute for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former senior adviser to George W.

{"id": 250290, "text": "A large-scale study of a single species of whale (Apatobium sp. glacialis) has shown that both the abundance and the distribution of these species correlate with the relative sizes of extant marine mammals. A recent, large-scale study of an ancient group of whales has shown that the size of a whale does not correlate with the distribution of its present population; however, a phylogenomic study of an extinct group of whales (Aceropus gasseri) has shown that the size of its present population is very similar on the ecological scale between present and new marine species. This study offers a framework for identifying whale numbers and distribution in marine mammal populations. A study that includes this group of whales is required not only to determine their historical status \u2013 for example, whether they are a member of a class of marine mammals, their range is wide or narrow in breadth but also the geographic location of their range and the level of ecological degradation \u2013 but also to assess the ecological status of their past ancestors, even before the present century with the establishment of an age transition mechanism.\n\nThe study (published online in J. Appl. Genet. , 2012) also shows that, although whales continue to be a global concern with the extinction of many species, the relative size and distribution of these marine mammals does not correlate with their present population density of extant populations. This suggests that both the current populations and the ecological status of today's whales are likely to be influenced by a changing climate in the future.\n\nThe present-day whale species are an important component of marine mammals in the world today. Although their numbers have become much smaller over the past 100 million years, their distribution still remains highly variable, and they have been isolated to a limited extent in their current geographical range (see Materials and Methods; for a description of this study see Text S1). Their ecological status is not the only factor that affects their distribution. For example, the large populations and abundance of large mammals that they occupy \u2013 such as whales \u2013 were not a common feature of early seafloor marine mammal groups of the early modern world. These recent studies show that although the relative size of present-day whales and the distribution by populations of other types of mammals are similar, their present population density is not necessarily affected by the present-day climate for which they were once confined.\n\nA recent paper (published in S. et al. Nat. Genet., 2014) shows that the proportion of whales with large numbers at different latitudes and different periods of their migration is a significant factor in the dispersal of populations between the present-day and the new-day world (see Text S2). The present-day populations of the two large-mammals (Apatobium sp. glacialis and Aceropus gasseri) are very similar, but have very different numbers of females and males and for many different species of marine mammals: Analysing their distributions, the authors also found a relation between the abundance and the size of new-day whales and their population size. But the same relation could be observed if their present population density were taken as a measure of their distribution of the larger marine mammals.\n\nWhale populations that appear not to be in any particular condition or for particular species and their total population size have been considered a potential candidate for a global climate change signal to be used as a possible proxy for the population dynamics of future whales (see Text S3, Discussion and Fig 1c). Such an event may be required to influence the relative size and distribution of future whales, and it could affect the relative numbers of the present group, as well as their current and future populations.\n\nWhale numbers have become the major source of uncertainty for a number of ecological studies of whales. In an ecological study (Berg\u00e5rd et al. 2010), the number of whales per hectare was measured from 2005 years (based on the same type of distribution data as the original paper) and was then based on the same distribution set as the previous study (Berg\u00e5rd et al., 2010, 2013) based on a new distribution set (Berg\u00e5rd et al., 2014), with a new type of analysis (Eriksson et al. 2008). These new sets of sampling set included data from the past 400,000 years, since these samples were very early. This new data set does not directly show that the distribution of whales had changed in the previous century. Rather, it shows that, as with the older sampling sets, the changes in the present-day population size were more or less pronounced during this time. The changes were quite sudden in the past century (Berg\u00e5rd et al., 2013) which indicates that this type of distribution analysis may not have been successful. Moreover, because of a long range of geographical variation between the time of the first study and now, the change in the present-day population size was particularly evident in the southern and western half of the world.\n\nA study of the present-day whale (Apat", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

There was another place you went when you signed up in 2000. What type of culture did you have and where did you go?\n\nI was kind of na\u00efve about that, so I just went to the best training camp on earth, and now we are going to be here for two months.

That is why some of the comments I see on the job postings here are downright bizarre. Even worse for us parents, when you look at job postings such as these, there are still many of those kids who really do need to be made little bit better because of what we're told to do or the consequences of it. For example, a lot of the comments are very serious and don't say anything about how your child is going to be raised. However, one comment about how children will get a good life. If you want children that \"do\" that job, that job, then that job is great for you. This is an obvious idea, but the reality is that a lot of people who see the job posting \"job offer\" or \"career\" and see \"child welfare\" or \"child protection\" or \"child welfare and child support\" as the one and only thing to do, will say you really can't \"save money by looking the other way.\" We all are in our own little gray room. If children are going to be left to fend for themselves and their own lives, it makes me sick to hear that this \"job offer\" is so ridiculous. If parents can't afford what they want to spend money for a child or just can't make ends meet, how on earth is anyone going to help save money by having kids to start with? It's too damn easy. When you hear someone \"choose to be a parent,\" that parent, when they decide to come to you and say \"yes, I want kids,\" they will say \"no, I want you to have kids,\" and they will take in things which are \"too great.\" As my friend, Jim, told me, \"I think when it comes to parenting I like to think about how we're going to be making these kids happy.\" Not that our parents don't say that. I remember one time during my first few months at college, with family, we learned how to go online at my favorite news site and we had a few meetings over a weekend at the library. The thing about this new group of parents is that when your child is younger than 10, they can't help you think about what you're going to do for them. That's OK. We've always known what they were going to do to make sure they got a job. Our children will have to learn how to handle things and understand all the steps we need to take to build up that mental, emotional, financial, emotional and physical infrastructure. One such thing is the way our children are raised. A lot of things we've heard the talk about our children going to college, work, and work again (if they're successful in those things) are really not true. They may be getting ready to become real adults (and if they fail in those then they're not just going to make this person more miserable, you really can't say that to me), but they still get the time to learn basic concepts like love, care, love for the kids, and a healthy respect for their mom. The very idea that a parent will choose to spend a whole month at a time at their job at work and not just on child care (which for me sounds great and makes me a perfect mom) is simply too dangerous. It's not really OK to tell our children how they will want to manage that \"work\" and \"career\" and to ask them to work hard, but it's okay to send a bunch of emails that say that you do that in order (and not when you want to). The idea of a kid being able to go to a job without a care center even though it's totally safe is so ridiculous that it's even a little insane and a bad idea. Don't worry, the kids who come to us and say their kid was doing that job are our best friends. We will care what they want to do with those kids and we will look after them and care for them when we need.", "length": 927, "ended": true}

In particular, companies are more cautious about labeling their products. Here's a rundown of major tobacco companies, and how to avoid getting caught up in the same traps.\n\nVaping (Vaping in this context is tobacco vapor that is packaged with tobacco and other chemicals)\n\nVaping is the process by which a user exhales, or inhales tobacco products (such as tobacco and tobacco products that are used on the market). It is generally used in medicine and health care, but if a user doesn't inhale or otherwise respond accordingly, tobacco companies are unlikely to make a profit and make those products available for free.\n\nIf someone's nicotine sensitivity continues to grow, it's likely that they could die.\n\nWhat is the effect that vaping has on your risk of developing lung cancer?\n\nThere are many variables that might affect whether a person has a risk for lung cancer:\n\n\nYour smoking, tobacco, or other substances\n\nWhat's the average amount of time you smoke during your lifetime and how many cigarettes and cigarettes per day you smoke\n\nWhat type of smoking habits is an individual prone to?\n\nWhat amount of cigarettes per month you're currently using and how many you're consuming\n\nYour tobacco habits (whether your use of tobacco or other substances)\n\nWhat is your daily level of cigarettes and/or tobacco products in your household?\n\nWhat type of tobacco product is used in the kitchen (or other public places)\n\nWhat kind of cigarette is consumed daily (a cigarette or a pipe, a pipe, or an aerosol?\n\nWhy are cigarettes and/or tobacco products sold on the Internet?\n\nWhy do they usually sell in large quantities?\n\nWhat is your percentage of the U.S. population that currently smokes cigarettes?\n\nDoes smoking influence your risk of major cardiovascular, autoimmune, cancers/cancer, skin diseases/mammograms, and cancers of the lungs?\n\nHave you ever felt unsafe in the first place?\n\nHow often do you vape?\n\nDoes the nicotine in your cigarette or pipe cause you to feel sick?\n\nDoes it increase the risk of developing heartburn?\n\nHow do you know if you're taking nicotine?\n\nCan you use nicotine without becoming high?\n\nDoes taking nicotine make you more sensitive to nicotine?\n\nHow can you tell if you have high blood pressure if you also have high cholesterol?\n\nAre there other risks such as being overweight or having diabetes?\n\n\nVaping cigarettes and pipe, pipe tobacco, or aerosol\n\nA wide variety of tobacco products and tobacco aerosols have been released and consumed in the U.S., including cigars, pipes, cigar tobacco wrappers, tobacco cans, e-cigarettes, and flavored tobacco products\n\nThere are also many other types of tobacco products and tobacco aerosols. Cigars, pipe tobacco, and flavored tobacco products, such as e-cigs and e-cigarettes, may contain nicotine or other products, as well as chemical tobacco products. This can lead to an increased risk of serious health problems like respiratory illness, lung cancer, heart ailments, cardiovascular events and stroke (including stroke and stroke-related heart attacks).\n\nIf you're concerned about using tobacco (especially with a high-prevalence of smoking, in combination with a high-prevalence of other factors that might be associated with smoking), the best approach is to stop taking certain tobacco products and/or pipe or aerosol products and/or use non-disperretive products instead.\n\nHow should I buy cigarettes, pipe tobacco, or aerosol products when purchasing cigarettes?\n\nMost of the time, cigarette and pipe tobacco products are the best, most affordable forms of tobacco when compared with other forms of tobacco that contain nicotine. However there are other ways to buy more nicotine (e.g., cigarettes online or in an aerosol pouch). Depending on the type of company that sells them and the amount of tobacco products they sell, it may be that they also sell cigarette vaporizers (which, in many cases, are made using chemicals) or aerosol cigarettes.\n\nSome people, like me, use a mixture of cigarettes, pipes, aerosols and e-cigarettes to avoid tobacco advertising. All are good ways to get around smoking. As long as you have to buy tobacco products online, they're pretty good.\n\nHow do I get started?\n\nThis article summarizes the various steps needed to get started with an effective tobacco product.\n\nStep 1: Use a smoking cessation product\n\nWhile smoking nicotine is a relatively safe and habit-forming activity, smoking is not without dangers. This includes:\n\nSmoking during sex or with friends\n\nSmoking while getting high (even if it's for long periods, or having sex)\n\nSmoking while trying to quit smoking\n\n", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

Some residents began taking to social media to express frustration that the U.S. had extended the extension of a five-year grant to six Chinese visa applicants over a six-month period as a \"tough choice\" to be fair to China in enforcing travel restrictions.\n\nThe U.S. visa waiver program has been on continuous roll out since President Donald Trump's inauguration. But even as the administration prepares to issue its final travel ban in January, it appears it can no longer hold back its efforts to crack down on foreigners from countries with human-trafficking operations.\n\nIn an effort to help some of those affected, state officials have issued temporary visas for Chinese nationals who have had their personal identification numbers turned over through the Federal Motor Carrier Liability Program or CBP, the visa waiver program, for three straight months. The change is the first in a series of changes and moves on government policies.\n\n\"The CBP and the Chinese Visa Waiver Program are one of the tools the Department has used to enforce its policy, which is meant to make it an easier, more pleasant way for the American people to seek assistance from the government for temporary government assistance after a visa suspension,\" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said after taking the administration's action.\n\nHowever, officials are hoping this temporary waiver program will make life easier for those who need it most. A recent study from the Pew Research Center's Center for the American People finds that those who have long-term visas and who have received an American citizenship offer more opportunities than those from previous immigrant groups. Overall, more than twice as many people believe that their current visas will make life better. Nearly a third of those affected are currently enrolled in public or private institutions.\n\nBut many of those people have already paid the price. After the Department of Homeland Security announced its own timeline for revoking the visa, which covers a maximum of three months, about 700 people have already applied. According to the Pew study, those people were the most likely to stay on those visas.\n\n\"This will create an additional cost to the state,\" said Daniel Karr, senior policy analyst for the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nAs long as the department is open to immigrants with family ties to those countries, the Department of Homeland Security could potentially close the visa applications of those affected for six months and give them the ability to stay. However, a DHS spokeswoman later said no such move has ever been made.\n\nAlthough the Department of Homeland Security did not offer additional details on those numbers, it's unclear what the federal department's new timeline would look like if an individual seeking a visa had applied for a similar waiver.\n\nOfficials were trying to keep his paperwork up to date when he applied for a visa, but it didn't have time to finish filing it because it's a lengthy process and doesn't fit into his personal timeline, an official involved in the investigation said. So authorities would wait for at least five more months. The department isn't sure when those provisional visas will be lifted.\n\nFollow James on Twitter at @JJames_MD", "length": 677, "ended": true}

This is used to avoid using different data format in different formats, for example, XML-RPC-RPC .\n\nbuild { \"import: \".foo\" , \"%s(%u|%u)|%u|%u|%u||\" \" \" \" }\n\nThis example produces a binary file which contains a number of files, such as a directory.

Just 48 percent said they saw \"very\" or \"somewhat\" positive things for him.\n\nA poll by Quinnipiac University found in January that 59 percent of Americans thought that Trump is an \"excellent choice.\" That's down from 62 percent last month (a Quinnipiac poll last month found 53 percent of people thought that Trump is the \"best choice,\" down from 67 percent).\n\nTrump did worse against Democrat Hillary Clinton, 49 percent to 49 percent. By April, 56 percent believed that Clinton would be a better commander in chief, down from 53 percent in February.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump's unfavorable ratings among Democrats were even worse. 47 percent gave the Republican a \"strong,\" while 28 percent said that Clinton would be better.\n\nThe Trump problem comes back to bite Hillary, 61 percent to 41 percent in February. The Democrats gave him 37 percent on the positive and 42 percent for the negative, down from 62 percent last month.\n\nIt's an interesting question, but this poll reinforces what I've been saying all along \u2014 Trump doesn't get enough support in his own right. You know, because he has a better shot of winning (though he's also far less popular with Democratic voters than Trump does with independents and independents with multiple party lines); he's better at getting the Republican to do the same, so as not to lose to a \"pro-Trump\" candidate (who actually could win).\n\nWhen we consider this new poll, it's striking that Republicans have been more negative toward all candidates compared to Democrats, with 69 percent saying they thought Donald Trump would be very good at \"winning,\" and 66 percent saying the same after his performance in New Hampshire with the Democrats in his place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose same voters also had a much easier time getting behind former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 62-46 percent to 19 percent. That number also dropped slightly in March after Trump's performance against Trump in the South.\n\nThat same voters also took up the possibility that Clinton would be able to win if elected president, up from 57 percent in February.\n\nWhat do you think about those results? Drop in the comments below.\n\n\"A couple of things here.\n\nFirst, I think the negative impressions of Trump are quite a bit lower than negative for Clinton. That's probably because they just didn't expect a negative reaction from such a person.

Col John Smith died of a heart attack at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in 1982 and was transferred to Arkansas prison for five years, on July 23. Four other men were captured and sentenced to life in prison after the conviction was dismissed.\n\nThe trial, due to resume in January with a pre-trial hearing scheduled for September, will be conducted by the U.S. Army Criminal Defense Office.\n\nDefense attorney Eric Rettig said a conviction of torture \"clearly violates the Fifth Amendment and should be overturned.\"\n\nSmith's attorneys argued that the Army had evidence \"in the military and intelligence community\" that the alleged interrogators were not fully capable of telling what he had done and that they were lying to the American public about the abuse of their service.\n\n\"He is a veteran of the greatest war on terrorism and an experienced military official and the public face of our national security apparatus. He should be convicted, however, of a first-degree murder,\" Rettig said in court. The defense argued that the soldier is guilty of manslaughter in this case.\n\nHe and another Army Ranger died at the base of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, while their captors were attempting to capture the U.S. Army Rangers in the spring of 2013, in what witnesses and former law enforcement and intelligence officials said was a botched and elaborate U.S. operation.\n\nSmith, who earned a B.A. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Cincinnati, was a top military contractor, a Navy SEAL, with Army special forces, according to military records.\n\nIn July, the Army said Smith and a fellow military official, Thomas Dennison, had been transferred to Fort Leavenworth to give them an opportunity to negotiate with the CIA and \"prevent the release of prisoners.\"\n\nSmith said Dennison told Dennison he wanted to kill his comrades and \"hide the fact that the American people were not going to surrender if he was captured again and executed, but would instead release it to help the American people and those in the enemy's charge, for their personal use ... and they would take care of the prisoners in their barracks as if they were animals.\"\n\nU.S. attorney Jeff Blumberg countered that he and Army interrogators were not fully capable of telling those lies.\n\n\"Defendants have not presented any evidence to the defense of their service in any military commission, that includes the military, the Army, or the national security community so far,\" he said. \"It is undisputed that the interrogators' performance in holding Sergeant Smith is at least as truthful as all other information that was presented.\"", "length": 645, "ended": true}

The APA recommended that the test be implemented at the highest level of management, including to the highest degree possible, for every patient regardless of the condition or the person, with the highest possible levels of management.\n\nThe study suggested that, if the test was available, most of the individuals receiving the new tests should be given the new diagnostic tests.\n\nThe APA also cited the \"significant potential of psychosocial and personality changes\" of different patients and families who were also diagnosed with depression.\n\nIn order to provide effective care to those who may be suffering mental health issues, the APA proposed that therapy is used to develop diagnostic tests to help treat the symptoms of mental health complications, such as schizophrenia.\n\nMany people are still unaware of the problems of bipolar disorder, making that diagnosis a difficult task for clinicians and patients alike. But research shows that some people are actually becoming very better at coping with mental illness.\n\nThe APA also recommended that the federal government provide funding for a new approach to psychiatry, called \"therapeutic psychiatry with the goal of improving and enhancing mental health outcomes that the public and society can benefit from,\" which seeks to \"enable the research community to develop and implement a comprehensive management strategy for mental health.\"\n\nFor most people, that might mean taking \"psychotropic treatments.\"\n\nIn one recent study of 4,955 young American adults, the majority received antidepressants (62 percent), but some have taken other medications (58 percent). But while some recent studies have shown improvement in symptoms at some levels, such as improving physical performance, some studies have found no evidence of improvement in others.\n\nIn a separate study, a group of 10,200 adults was asked to complete questionnaires and asked where they were on the continuum of psychotic symptoms from depressive episodes to other psychotic episodes. Over one year they were told about how many days they had been on antidepressants that year before making a diagnosis, in detail, with a clear picture of their symptoms.\n\nThe people who took the antidepressant medications were found to be significantly more likely to be more likely to be depressed, with higher rates of being diagnosed with \"disorders from depression\" and more frequent episodes of depression.\n\nThe APA found that the patients who took the antidepressant medications were equally as likely to have depressive episodes (39 percent) or at higher risk (36 percent) of major depressive disorder (MDD) because the drug treatment had low doses and the medication could be used less often than usual.\n\n\"This evidence supports the need for continued efforts to provide pharmacological treatment for patients who experience a disorder that is unique to the individual, even when that disorder does not require physical treatment for which there would otherwise be limited access\" to effective treatment, the APA concluded.\n\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association, the majority of people who have the illness do not have a high level of treatment. But if any of them don't receive a level of treatment, others may find it challenging to work with their mental health.

And it's a good thing for the world to know that when they leave their home and go into their own life\u2014especially when those who have gone into an eternal life are coming back to their homes, or their families. And when those who come back to their home enter the kingdom of heaven, they are coming back to their home and coming back into the kingdom of heaven. And when they come back to their house, they will be gathered together for the Father, and for the Son, and for the Holy Spirit.\" [1 Cor 10:10]\n\nThis isn't some kind of mystical message for people who are trying to reconcile their beliefs with reality. To take a stab at it, for a fact, in this post on religious dogma about death I'll say:\n\nThe issue doesn't have to be this simple: the doctrine of the gospel is being embraced in Christianity. It's also happening in other religions. As we have seen (see 1 Cor 13,) the Catholic Church can change the doctrine about afterlife. They should accept that the doctrine of faith is universal, which means that the Church can continue, under the Church's rules, to support the universal teachings of the Jewish saints. And even if that changes, the Church will still have to abide by the Bible's rules and accept any teachings, such as the one we have here on Earth that does not recognize the Jewish saints (1 Cor 5:21; see also 1 Cor 13:14).\n\nAnd we've seen that the Church continues to follow the Jewish saints: As we noted here earlier, the Church continues to have apostolic rule and authority over all its bishops throughout its lifetime, including many prominent Church officials like Patriarch Peter. Peter's death is a reminder that the Church is being taken over and will continue to have authority over him. As a consequence, many of those who think that such a drastic change could occur are using the same exact argument that the Church's current head of the Faith Ministry, Bishop Mark II, used to make to his fellow bishops about Jesus's death and resurrection. What was the point of Mark II, that he had been telling the truth about the Jesus story on the cross with his teaching that Jesus was resurrected to take the earth and leave it to Him, when that was not the truth? I would argue that this was the point that Mark II was in favor of. Since the Church was also taking over the world's economy, a lot of people would simply assume that the Jewish saints were resurrected to take all the earth and move people to their own homes, just not what the Church is teaching that is being taught today.\n\nBut it's important to note that this isn't really an issue that is going to change anything. The fact is we don't understand the doctrine of the church anymore. We understand that what God will provide for us, what He loves, will change what He commands. Therefore, the reality is that we can't change it without understanding why it's being preached by people who are teaching these teachings, who do not understand the teachings, and who are not willing to change them.\n\nAs more and more Christians accept the teachings of Jesus as true and eternal, so will they be able to reconcile their beliefs with reality as they believe them to be true and eternal. While we're at it, let's not forget how difficult it can be to put together a \"just for you\" mission in this country when people who are in need of a financial help for their child need it so that they can help find their needs elsewhere.\n\nThere are also more and more young women who are desperate to get out of diapers right now. The very possibility of putting them to sleep at home, while they still have their diapers, will likely kill them, leaving countless young women homeless and at risk for pregnancy and life without an infant. I can understand why they're so desperate because of how hard it can be to get on with a life that they feel comfortable with for the sake of helping out other women, while others aren't.\n\nBut this isn't the end game. There is going to be other things to remember as we continue to grow up in a world of people who are trying desperately to find new, better ways to live. So let's talk about just one of those things: love.\n\nIn the next post, I'll talk about the benefits of love.\n\nIf Jesus's words were to inspire more families like this, they may seem like they are the best ways to help out as a country. As we've seen in other instances in Canada and Europe, a lot of times people in these countries can't really believe they are even able to live their lives in harmony. They are living in a world where they have to prove them, they have to be able to show them things they may have considered just by speaking to them.

Today, more than half of U.S. cities and more than 90 percent of states have some form of new infrastructure in their planning and implementation systems; new public transit systems are emerging that can provide access to a variety of services for citizens; new and ongoing infrastructure projects are increasingly available to the general public.\n\nThe U.S. continues to build out a vast network that includes the sprawling downtown Chicago of the Mid-City International Airport, the largest in the world; an expansive highway system in San Francisco, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison as part of its Center for Transit Services.\n\nUW officials estimate that nearly 80 billion metric tons of new public infrastructure has been built over the past 30 years since World War II. \"With that number and the many investments it makes, Chicago ranks as an essential hub for U.S.-led international rail service,\" says Michael R. Jurecki, a UW Professor of Economics and Government at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.\n\nThe study shows that during the first half of the 19th century, the U.S. built half of the country's roads. Since the 1960s, that number has doubled. The new report, titled \"Traffic on the New Transportation Agenda,\" looks at what cities and states have done to address transportation needs, and concludes with a list of key findings. The following charts highlight highlights some of the important findings.\n\n1. Roads remain an essential part of the daily grind\n\nWith over 50 years of experience in the real estate construction industry, U.S. officials estimate that about 80 percent of the country's road infrastructure today is built in the form of bridges, roads, and railways and in addition to buses, trains, light trucks and trains. Over 2.1 billion metric tons of new government funds were allocated for roads during the first half of the 20th century; about 18.8 percent of these funds were spent on building highways. In contrast, in 2004, when the nation's total transportation infrastructure was $6,900 billion, the U.S. allocated nearly 17.2 percent of this funding for roads to states (although at this point of the 20th century the total public infrastructure in the United States was nearly $9,900 billion).\n\nAs of June 2016, there were 535 metropolitan regions with infrastructure available to build on. Of those, 11 metropolitan areas met these criteria for transportation infrastructure:\n\nWashington: The federal government currently spends $5.8 billion to spend on the roads and bridges of the United States to avoid congestion (this figure is based on the 2005 Comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement of the State of Washington.)\n\nWashington, D.C.: Between 1993 and 2010, the federal government built more than $700 billion worth of new roads and highways; the number of projects increased from 16,000 in 1994 to 17,700 in 2010; the number of projects built in the last ten years grew from 21,000 in 1997 to 32,000 in 2010 by 1.55 percent. The federal government projects construction of more than 200,000 bridges and tunnels to ease congestion by the end of 2011. As of this year, the number of construction projects projects in the U.S. increased from 50 to more than 100,000 over the last 10 years.\n\nAtlanta: At the dawn of the 1980s the U.S. built almost $400 million worth of new federal roadways. More than 50 percent of these new highway projects were built within the first 10 years of construction from 1993 to 2012, with the total total of new roadways built between 2012 and 2010 exceeding 7.8 billion. Since 1990, road construction in the U.S. has been at a historic low: In 2006, road construction was nearly 60 percent funded by the federal government, but has since dropped to 39 percent.\n\nHouston: The U.S. spends about $9.8 billion on road infrastructure in 2010, up from $7.2 billion in 1994. In the 15 years through 2010, the amount of funding spent on road infrastructure in the U.S. was nearly 1,650 billion dollars (the number of miles traveled per day in 2011 is 1.9 billion).[1]\n\nKansas City: Despite the massive amounts spent on road infrastructure by the U.S. government, nearly half of the state's roadway projects were funded by the state (down from 17 percent in 1993 to 17 percent in 2010).[2]\n\nKansas City: During the same 15 years, Kansas City has more roadway projects planned for expansion than any other city in Kansas, totaling $1.6 billion (12 out of 22 projects).

{"id": 250318, "text": "The new, non-traditional, and more \"traditional\" approach of allowing women to have children was created in 2003 and is generally regarded as a continuation of the 1970s. It is a policy supported by governments that was developed by the U.S. and is now in favor of the traditional gender system. A major cause of female empowerment are the efforts to improve the quality of life of men, and therefore have improved women's relationships with men and with their partners and with the world at large. However, as this policy has been challenged by the lack of equality since the 1980s, it has become increasingly difficult to find meaningful ways at home to support their family. There are currently only 11 gender-segregated schools in the U.S., including 14 that have not received Title IX enforcement over the last five years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The women's studies program that has had the most recent gender-segregated public funding is part of a push in recent years to \"reduce the number of public schools that receive Title IX guidance in some cities.\"\n\nAs stated above, it is very possible, and sometimes even likely, that a government grant could have greater impact on the women-focused movement than a federal grant, or that an existing program would have an impact on a women-focused movement in some cities than in others. This is because women are overwhelmingly considered to be part of the \"problem\" of our time. Many would rather be forced into the \"problem\" of being raped, and have to be forced to deal with men they do not want to sexually assault, than be a victim of violence.\n\nWhat does this really mean?\n\nAccording to the most recent Women's Studies Initiative at the University of Mississippi, \"there is an unspoken but very strong gender role within the movement, including and particularly within the female student body, with many women having to deal with physical or sexual violence and the consequences for their well-being.\" The National Women's Law Center stated that:\n\nOne of the biggest concerns we see with the current approach to addressing gender harassment and sexual assault in the first place is that it is almost impossible to get to the right solution for addressing the many problems that remain for women, and not the solution alone. It is clear that as women, we should not treat the victims, and that is why this effort to get to the right solution is crucial. For this reason, we have taken a policy approach to the issue. The best place to start is by focusing on the issues addressed most directly, and making a difference in the lives of women. In doing so, we will ensure that the problem is solved and the issues resolved.\n\nThe national organization of women's organizations is a coalition of nearly 25,000 organizations across the country that advocate for and advocate to make the lives of women more equitable for women. Our goal is threefold.\n\nFirst, we will create awareness of the issues, and use government policy to make these issues better addressed. Second, we will push back on the policy to address the causes and ways to prevent and combat the issue while encouraging women to work together to change them, and making it better understood that they really must work together as a society to ensure equitable and full participation of all communities, and to reduce harm to women by supporting and training them to have positive or constructive careers. Third, we will bring on some form of feminist civil rights to encourage women to come forward, and to educate them about the power of violence.\n\nMany women believe that this is where our movement can start to grow if we are not focused on the problem, and focus instead on fighting it together to solve it.\n\nThe recent Women's Justice Initiative, in partnership with the World Human Trafficking Campaign, was a big step forward. The project, aimed at ending the practice of sexual exploitation of children, raised $28 million from nearly 1,200 organizations, and was made possible through the efforts of the World Human Trafficking Campaign.

(White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement that the president had not made that comment.)\n\nEven before Trump was on the campaign trail, some Republican allies had expressed concern that Trump's recent criticism of Obama and the Affordable Care Act might undermine the administration's efforts in keeping out foreign adversaries.\n\nA senior former Trump aide said last week that the Trump-backing, anti-immigrant rhetoric of the previous two Trump administration predecessors \"shows a very, very weak commitment on the part of the White House to diplomacy in general \u2026 and it's a kind of back-and-forth situation.\"\n\nTrump's tweet prompted much of the conservative news media's attention.\n\n\"I mean, if you ever got into some of these meetings, you're gonna have somebody screaming, 'Oh, look what was done,' \" said Dan Coats, a Republican strategist.\n\nWhen pressed for his thoughts on how Trump's tweets might explain the president's position, Coats said it was still \"very murky.\"\n\n\"We're not at any moment in their history with the Trump administration and it's not like we do anything very different in other countries than we did in the past,\" he said of \"the way in which our president acts in the world,\" which sometimes means acting \"very quickly\" on the issue.\n\nBut co-author of the article, Bill Browder, said there was \"much more to it\" than just Trump's tweets.\n\n\"I think that's all worth asking as a question, and this is something that the president is very passionate about, and it's not really about whether or not we need to do anything much of a change in our current foreign policy, it's about what we need to do for the country going forwards,\" Browder said, according to Bloomberg.\n\nWhen asked for his thoughts as to how Trump might go about his foreign policy, Browder said to keep \"some distance\" from this topic.\n\n\"I'm a big fan of people saying, 'I understand that, people say that,' \" he said, the New York Times reported at the time. \"But that's an issue for a different discussion. If we do more of the same, we'll be happy. But this is like a different topic. Trump's tweeting is going to take us farther than any of the other candidates, because his tweets are not going to have an impact in terms of the other candidates in the race.\"\n\nAs we reported earlier this year, President Donald Trump's Twitter use is part of a larger pattern in which he seems increasingly focused on himself, and what makes him successful or unsuccessful.\n\nHis style and his personality sometimes veer from the real-estate mogul's personal image to something much more personal and personal in which he tends to be more in his own company, and takes on less of the spotlight of the Trump Organization.\n\nHe frequently gives interviews on TV and on Fox News, which is part of the GOP establishment, and gives much more than an occasional shout-out to the president. And Trump has not been afraid to take part in his own private conversations, a view he took to task after Trump threatened to \"impersonate\" him over his comments to a reporter at CPAC.\n\nIn a speech a week ago at the Brookings Institution, Trump said that he was \"disappointed\" with his foreign policy \"and I think that's unfortunate, because they have tried a lot, but it's not working. If you look at how he's dealing with the press, and it's worked, he's a lot more comfortable with what they are saying, and I mean, if he was president, he's been very successful.\"\n\nA week earlier, Trump had announced that he had asked Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to chair an inquiry into Russian influence inside the Trump team to be opened by a special counsel, the Times reported last week. In a speech, the president described his conversations with Sessions, saying, \"He has always been a man of principle and, you know, and the problem with Democrats and Republicans is that they want their ideas from people who don't have them.

Richard J.

Ed DeLong (D-Conn.), who also chairs the committee, wrote in a memo to his colleagues that \"one possibility was that one of the Republicans on the committee did not see any other information\" out of \"a dirty trick.\"\n\nThe Democrat-controlled Senate also said the committee had given conflicting information as in the House.\n\nSen. Bob Schilling (R-Minn.) said Tuesday on \"The View\" that his colleagues thought it \"just doesn't matter what you say.\"\n\n\"Let's say you are trying to discredit John Kerry, and I would like to see the Republicans call him and explain that what he did was wrong as far as what we're trying to do, but I think there are more to it,\" Schilling said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\n\"I think the whole party is totally focused on the House investigation that's going on right now, so I don't want to get caught, because he won't lose.

And the new, campus-wide plan that was unveiled Tuesday at the end of the year will ensure that those programs are delivered for graduate students on time and that it will also be a place where students are encouraged to attend for the first time.\n\n\"We believe that there should be three-year plans of the next three years and that they are based at the University,\" said Mark Linton, dean of the Graduate School of Science and Engineering at the University of Hawai'i. That way, graduate students will be able to see both the first two years of their careers and the third through the final two years.\n\nWith the addition of the new campus, UH plans to provide two classes per semester and a minimum of three majors per year for students graduating in 2015\u2014two majors with no previous experience before enrolling in a computer science degree.\n\n\"The students will see at least four major programs through each one of these three years,\" Linton said.\n\nIn addition to the one-year plan, the University will offer programs in health sciences, business and engineering, digital marketing and business and engineering.\n\nWhile the school does not offer the latest versions of the six major science degree categories for graduate students this year, it also includes the undergraduate-level program, which includes many of the program standards and skills they need for the course. And the university hopes that, along with the second-semester major, students will be able to get an overall understanding of business and business-industrial models and technologies.\n\n\"We are committed to being a leader in that field, and I think it will be something that our students, faculty and students will be able to participate in as they see fit,\" said William Denton, who directs computer science programs at UH. \"This is the first time we've had such a large concentration of undergraduates in a science program since we saw two years ago.\"\n\nThe second-year program will be called the bachelor of commerce degree and offer bachelor's and master's degrees in business and manufacturing.\n\nThe third-year program, which also includes a master's and a bachelor's, will also offer an advanced degree of commerce and computer science and will offer at least one certificate of commerce (certificate of business in a foreign country). That's all being taken into account for the two-year plan.\n\nThe three-year plan does not include college, but it is designed to create a safe environment for graduate students in the technology industry, said Linton, who is the vice chancellor for graduate program planning.\n\n\"The three-year plan is where we're most excited about it and has seen the results to be so positive, so they're excited to take the leap,\" he said at a news conference. \"So it represents a lot of flexibility for our students\u2026 it is very exciting to see we're developing the future of our STEM fields as well as the next big thing.\"\n\nIf graduates want to take the big money gamble, that money should come from the state.\n\nThe university will invest in three campuses and will have a number of buildings for students that will have a variety of classrooms to offer and will work with many colleges and universities to develop a new campus plan for students that is consistent with the University of Hawai'i's commitment to student success, Linton added.\n\n\"The university will have many of the building we've had success with at the Bay Area,\" Linton pointed out. \"For instance, we have a lot of new buildings from the university and we also have over 20,000 students in the campus. So we can be very competitive and we can be very open and responsive to all needs.\"\n\nUH is not a business school and does not have a partnership-based relationship with any major-related business schools.\n\nHowever, the university hopes for a lot to do in the future, which may include a commitment to a research program and a focus on entrepreneurship and how technology interacts with technology.\n\n\"It is exciting that the technology industry is evolving,\" Linton said. \"The universities are doing so well so there has been significant growth. From my perspective, our plan is quite simple: We'll focus on the computer science-oriented degrees and we're going to have many new, diverse, innovative courses, courses that students can take from our four undergraduate science programs and we'll try and improve our approach by taking those ideas as they come through at our campuses.\"\n\nThe plan also gives students the option of graduating", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

Research suggests that eating sweet foods is linked to heart health issues.\n\nThere are other high-fat, low fat (VLDL) foods in the supermarket, in the home, and in food packaging. Many of these foods have a high fiber content, which can inhibit the formation of plaque. In fact, a recent study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that a 20 percent increase in the absorption of sugarcane (i.e., salt and pepper) from vegetables resulted in a 30 percent increase in plaque formation.\n\nSugarcane was also found to be significantly more easily absorbed than other flavors of food. Researchers found that eating a high fiber, low fat (VLDL) diet had a 10 percent reduction in blood glucose and a 22 percent decrease in triglycerides.\n\nA study from Australia found that consuming a low-sugar diet did increase triglycerides (glucose and the like), while less-sugar foods had none.\n\nThe same study found that low sodium consumption, which is associated with reduced levels of cholesterol and insulin, has been associated with lower blood sugar, especially in diabetic patients.\n\nIn the same study, researchers found that a sugar-free, plant-based diet reduced inflammation, inflammation, and blood sugar.

There's a Linux kernel for every Linux package you can imagine. And we're trying to get Linux to have a better implementation of all of the components that you look at, what we call \"virtual\" modules in the kernel. That's something that we'll have to see if it's ready.\n\nSo, what do you recommend to people that want a full Linux system?\n\nSome people that want to use OpenCL already know how to open an OpenCL server.

(On their first anniversary, they did not hear from their manager, Jim Epstein, and had \"not heard from the man who would be their manager in the future.\")\n\nBy this time, they had been told they were leaving the group, but only because another manager was available. A month later \u2014 just three months after Polly left \u2014 the band announced it would stop recording with the original members, and \"they have been taken for a few days to a local hospital,\" the article added, because \"the Beatles have not returned to the recording studio.\"\n\n\"The Beatles left us, but they did not leave any records. We took them to Los Angeles, got my mail, put them in their car and we took them to Hollywood. But after it fell apart from there and came out, I was left alone, never saw the group again. A woman told me the Beatles moved into the group because it was different. The group kept up with us and made it clear it was the same.\"\n\nKilled In 1987\n\nWhile most of her former band members were dead in 1987, some lived to tell of other events. Some of those who died were \"people I admired\" or \"People I had a crush on,\" one member told The Post.\n\n\"It was hard when these people don't say how they died,\" she said.\n\nOthers were \"friends of people you loved.\"\n\n\"There is something sick about talking about some other, very sad people and people I really trusted,\" she said. \"It took a huge amount of courage to think that I could forgive them for who they were.\"\n\nBut she added: \"And it didn't take much courage to let them know that we were still together in that sense.

It was the perfect time to get your fix of this week's season's race: the long, arduous Formula 1 season.\n\nAll the top teams were playing on track in the F1 world class, and Ferrari were up-and-down in both the constructors' and the drivers' standings.\n\nIn what was an increasingly heated and unpredictable race, a series of incidents were reported, as well as a series of broken rules. Here is part of what was reported, along with the full results from these incidents:\n\nThe following day, two drivers were charged with assault and the driver who tried to stop him was released.\n\nAfter that, the race started in earnest. The FIA put a limit on the race length to five hours.\n\nTwo of the teams had won.\n\nAnd on the 24th, the race went on. In the first race, the race's organizers went on-line again to report that the race was not over. They made the usual announcement \"We have a very good, strong team and if it is not over on our schedule, we will not race again.\" (Source)\n\nAt the end of the day, the drivers were fined $50,000 from their sponsorship, with the penalty only based on the fact that they failed to take the test on time on the day on which they went into the field. The rest of the event got the opposite treatment.\n\nTwo teams did not make the cut and the penalties were increased by the time a Ferrari drive took place.\n\nBoth the Ferrari owners and McLaren drivers were fined more than $45,000 by the FIA for the failure to take the test.\n\nFerrari lost four of their four points to Mercedes\n\nThey are going to the finish of the season but only once: on Sunday when it was announced that the only other time they will get the chance to go to the world championships was in the Formula 3 championship. In the F3 season, McLaren were awarded another six points just once in the season before. Their time on track was then halved to seven to represent Bahrain.\n\nIf things don't get out of hand until this Friday, the FIA, in their latest press release, have already confirmed the McLaren driver has lost three points to Sauber, which are the only real reasons for this latest story.\n\nIf this is Ferrari's reaction, then there's nothing to believe. They're a bit of an \"attention-seeking bunch\", and if they don't like the way things go in Bahrain, they don't even care.\n\nThe story has now just been confirmed that the race can be won by the McLaren driver. In the meantime, don't miss the live stream:\n\nUPDATE: All of you who are still attending the Monaco Grand Prix at the end of this month will be lucky to get your hands on both race reports. The live stream is now live on F1 F1.com.\n\nThe Monaco Grand Prix was just revealed. See the full live blog here:\n\nUPDATE 2 1/5: This post had been edited to clarify that the three drivers are not being paid for the work done by the FIA. The three drivers who participated in the Monaco Grand Prix were paid for a job, not for testing.\n\nI'm really impressed about this story, and I can hear some pretty decent and very good points being made to both teams about how the money should be redistributed to the poor.\n\nUPDATE 3 1/10: A video showing how Mercedes, Lotus, and Red Bull are handling all the important details of the race was just reported by the site Sportr.\n\nAll of this is good news because the team is making a big step forward in 2017 \u2013 there's no sign of an increase in the amount of money they will be paying for races this year. In fact, the car, as far as I'm aware as of, is worth $50,000 dollars.\n\nUpdate 3: It seems like Ferrari did make it to the French Grand Prix with some good news.\n\nIt turns out that the team will pay for the technical details in the races after they have the cars in stock for an emergency. The FIA have now told the Mercedes, Lotus, and Red Bull teams to complete a detailed race report to confirm that they won the race.\n\nIn case you haven't already \u2013 Ferrari's official statement states that the FIA did not order any further changes to track conditions to this particular race.\n\nUpdate 4 1/14: This post is going through several changes to how the drivers will be paid. These will only apply to the drivers who did race last year and did not participate in the race.

Horsley, founder and president of Democracy, Research and Liberty of Pennsylvania. \"But I believe that politicians, and others like them, are not alone in this.\n\n\"That's a good thing because it shows this issue is a national debate. It's not a partisan affair. It's a political issue; it's about our Constitution and the power of the people.\"\n\nAs of June 15, 2017, over half of the state's votes in the election were cast by Republicans. While majorities of voters who supported Clinton and Trump won't likely show up in the polls to vote, they will still make up over five-in-ten of the national electorate, according to the Pew Research Center. The Republican victory on Thursday is also likely to generate a lot of enthusiasm for the party, which could turn into an upset if Trump can win the majority of states.\n\nThat enthusiasm may translate to more votes in 2016, which could bring Republicans into electoral contention with Donald Trump's win in a number of states.\n\nThere are more races and elections in the US for Republican Party offices than at any time in recent memory, and they're still in flux. In some places the party has been able to avoid all sorts of state or national elections through the election of state senators and elected officeholders rather than running their own primaries or caucuses, said Jonathan C. Schofield, director of the Center for American Progress. While he doesn't expect a major upset in 2016, that could bring about a backlash in the states who might opt out of the general election.\n\n\"We are still in a race for the presidency,\" Schofield said. \"And if Trump loses that race, the Republican Party could face backlash in states like Mississippi and Ohio.\"\n\nRepublicans and Democrats on the other hand will face some of the same challenges the party has faced for years. The Democrats can't rely on their state party to help it pull off its most controversial victory yet by running a presidential bid, Schofield said. For that reason, it likely won't be too long before Democrats are forced to rely on national parties, as they can't run their own primaries or caucuses.\n\n\nEven the most liberal party does not need to look far to find out its candidate is getting ahead in Florida, which Trump has done well in recent weeks. The Republican Party will have to use its own independent candidates and field offices next week to have the necessary delegates to ensure their nomination at the convention. The RNC would then have to pick up the pieces after the convention and make a decision on whether to hold nominating contests as the party heads into April. It also has to decide in November when it would vote to hold primaries nationally again, Schofield added.\n\nBut if those decisions come down to state party committees and superdelegates on the November ballot, the party has to be ready to roll over and run an unifying presidential campaign or more, he said.\n\nTrump had promised to be aggressive in talking about how he would attack Hillary Clinton, but the presumptive Democratic nominee has consistently dropped hints that she would try to cut his tax, trade, housing, and education policies.", "length": 664, "ended": true}

{"id": 250336, "text": "\nThis article is available for viewing in PDF, JSTOR, and PDF format.\n\nThere are various classes of players, but none of them are the easiest or the most interesting: both players play with real people.\n\nIn this article, we'll look at the basic rules for playing with real people. The rules are organized into a list of three basic principles, that may appear in less than half of the pages.\n\nIn our discussion of using real people, we'll start by laying out a few basics:\n\nYou can't use a word on what kind of game you want, since the rules and the rules themselves are subjective (and can vary in quality). You can't tell your opponent to play with you for an extended period of time if he or she actually does. If you can't tell your opponent what kinds of games you want, you'll have to show her or his or her that it's for a game you already know. On the other hand, it's much more likely you can tell the player who won the game that they're playing with you because he or she probably actually knows a lot more than you do.\n\nLet's start with just a few basic rules. The first rule is the same in every player. It's not just whether you're playing with a few friends, but also whether you're playing with people who have different tastes and abilities. You can't play with people who also play with each other. Only members of another group can play together. We don't have an exact timeline for the game we play, but we assume that we're going to take place roughly in the middle of the day.\n\nThis rules does not require a particular type of \"mechatization\" in the game mechanics (that the player has seen so far). Instead, I'd say that it's a little less likely that you can say, \"Well, I have three members of my party, and I've never met anyone like you.\" In other words, people can't use their actual names to play. A little more information is required\u2014it's not really clear why they have to choose.\n\nSo, the basic rules of the game:\n\nThere are three ways in which you can play as a real person (or not): by playing as a person of interest, a character, or simply by moving along.\n\nIf you're playing on a PC, I would suggest you use your mouse.\n\nIf you're playing on a Mac, I would suggest you use your PC.\n\nIf you're playing on Windows, I would suggest you use the mouse.\n\nIf you are playing using a keyboard (a little like a touchscreen), I would suggest you use the mouse.\n\nYou'll notice an interesting rule: once the game starts, you cannot move or interact with an object until your hand turns to the front of the screen. So, if you have a little piece of paper to start a new game, you don't really need to do this. However, if you can play your hand around the table, this rule breaks the rule that games on PC are impossible.\n\nThe game starts out with your hands completely turned. As you play, you must take a set of basic moves, called \"steps,\" that will allow you to play a basic game of real people that are either in your hand or in your space. Step 1 is the same as step 3, but if you don't make it on time, you'll lose your hand because you couldn't move quickly enough. Here's how I would play a video game without this feature.\n\nStep #1 The step can be made very simple, like this:\n\n1) Play the first basic move of the game (not in my hand, and you can make it on time: click here to find out)\n\n2) The second step (and this one you can make on time in the same way with Step 1 and Step 2, and the rules above may look something like this)\n\n3) Play and move.\n\nThe rules will be sorted by their number of turns of play. If you can have up to three players on a board, then the rules change every turn. The rules don't actually change how a person acts at every turn, but they do change how people play.\n\nStep #3 The last step is a little easier, like this:\n\n1) Play the last basic move of the game (not in my hand)\n\n2) The second one (the first one is what you need to keep in mind while playing)\n\n3) The third one (the first one has more details about the moves you need then the second one, as you can make it easier to play it on your own time (check out the video below).\n\nThis is a bit confusing at first. But it was what you wanted.\n\nThis doesn't mean we can not play like this. It means you can make", "length": 1024, "ended": false}
{"id": 250337, "text": "A month before he announced today that he's not running for the Democratic nomination, Donald Trump's campaign took part in a rally Monday night in South Carolina with anti-Semitic themes and chants that included anti-Semitic phrases such as 'God hates Jews, they're like the Nazis,' 'Kill them all,' 'Keep them out of our country,' and 'Kill them all' (which was just a variation of the phrase, 'get rid of them'). This weekend in Mississippi, Trump also attended a rally in Mississippi titled 'The Jewish People Get Involved. They Will Save Our Country.'\n\nThat was a big night for this part of Trump's candidacy, and he's doing this in response to this week's white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Trump went on television on Friday morning and made a few incendiary tweets about women, Muslims, blacks, and Hispanics. He has attacked North Carolina Sen. Luther Strange and has called for black mayors and state legislators to resign because they've been \"n****'ed.\" In a bizarre twist of fate, on Monday, Trump has even attempted to name Hillary Clinton's opponent and vice presidential nominee and even has suggested that former President Bill Clinton is \"the greatest liar ever born.\"\n\nIf Trump's remarks go all the way, the race will come down to a fine point, with Hillary Clinton getting the votes and Donald Trump getting the far right endorsements in the Republican primary race. Trump is taking things a step further, announcing Sunday \"That Hillary Clinton is running for president again,\" which will be the same for other big names, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), all of whom are currently competing to be the GOP's standard-bearer.\n\nTrump is certainly going to get some attention with his new comments, but not so much with his campaign. After all, as Politico reported Sunday (see above), Trump actually believes that his campaign needs some sort of \"diverse field\" to get its own candidate on this stage. On the other hand, there seem to be a lot of candidates across the board who have been working for Trump, and there have been some of them. For example, the fact that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo endorsed Trump for President might play into that, as a Democratic front-runner this week, and the fact that the New York Republican was endorsed by a Trump ally may help.\n\nIt is not clear if they're really competing to take the place of the 2016 Republican nominee, or whether Trump is ready to give his campaign a shot in the arm. For now, it's clear that if they do decide they can actually use the primary season for their own benefit, they won't stop there with some other candidates on the ticket.\n\n[Featured Image by Kevin Winter/Getty Images]", "length": 573, "ended": true}

{"id": 250339, "text": "I'm very disappointed that the NFL fined me because I believe there needs to be more protections for women at the NFL level. I have a feeling that there will be no more protections from other athletes over the next few years, and I do not believe in using the NFL's decision as an opportunity to make changes. It will be up to other teams to respond on their own if necessary. We'll see what happens after that. If there is any doubt, it is that women's rights are a real hot football issue.\n\nIt is no secret that the NFL's decision does not take women's rights into consideration or in the context of women playing sports. Players are expected to participate in women-only sports, and the policy seems to be that it's only for football. While this doesn't seem so bad for players, it makes it extremely difficult for women to participate. If the NFL wanted to make a more proactive case, it wouldn't be able to make a comment if the commissioner disagrees with it.\n\nLet's keep in mind that for a business like the NFL, this is a very big deal. Women make up only 26 percent of the NFL's total roster, and only five percent of all NFL wide receivers commit to their respective teams. If the league would have enforced the new rule in a more respectful way, if women's rights was a priority, then that would mean they would have taken a much stronger stance towards the policy itself, whereas men are often more vocal in their opposition to it because of their job security.\n\nThe NFL can make or break its policy. That's why I'm so disappointed that the league fined me for my vote. It's a shame that a group like the NFL's can't stand to feel this. I've seen other athletes do a lot more for women at different levels, and women's rights don't get any bigger. If we're going to be playing hardball over women's issues, let us change the policy. We cannot simply continue to try to silence the movement with our own language.\n\nThe league needs to take more care of players. Players should play more for the game. Women's sports are a great time for all players to be on the field. It may help them realize their potential, but when women lose to men in league play, that's when that moment is going to come. I personally won't be running in 2020 in my senior year, but I could make it happen. The NFL seems to be focused on making a decision based on women's needs at the top of their priority list.\n\nWe cannot let it be that the NFL has stopped women from being on every roster and that it makes it so much more difficult that the NFL will allow them to take a stand on their issues. They do have players who are just as passionate and dedicated to their team, but it's only going to get worse. If the fact remains that the NFL has kept its mouth shut and not stepped forward or made any changes in the direction their players are now living in, they are likely to change their priorities even more.", "length": 628, "ended": true}
{"id": 250340, "text": "Toughness is key to any game, regardless of size, difficulty level or style of play.\n\nTake the simple game of DnD; every time I use the spell \"Flaming Arrows\" I get an extremely low spell resistance. Using an axe in the middle of the map gives you an extra hit point.\n\nBut it only takes one hit. If you kill all zombies in your path they will still have a lower level of armor and/or some pretty good stats. The second time I use this, this is the most crucial aspect of the game. You should really be able to quickly use this to your advantage since once you have used it a hundred times you won't be able to use the last two.\n\nIn most other games the only thing that will be damaging you, is a zombie that you can't kill. Zombies are not always lethal (just be careful with them and just make sure they are NOT using melee weapons); so you should be able to get behind your target by using multiple, but very slow, melee stabs. Zombies can also be very quick and easily targeted with a simple, powerful ranged attack of almost every type.\n\nIf you really need to protect your targets, this is one reason that the game is such a great place to start - you have to be able to shoot, dodge and hit. Even then it is very difficult to get in between your zombie traps for very long periods of time. Don't give up trying your best to get within an inch of the front of a building. You also can sometimes get inside with a few quick stabs; and I am not going to spoil any of these with this.\n\nNow if you want to survive and take the next step, the most important part of your plan is to take the second turn. You have to start with a Zombie and an Engineer. The best way to start out is to get your Zombies in a safe area and then you can begin destroying them in a small or large number of turns. This process lasts about 6 to 10 turns, depending on your character's speed and skill with the Spell.\n\nThe next thing to deal with is your Zombies, especially when trying to survive a zombie onslaught. You should always keep two Zombie in melee at all times, and one on the ground as well as in a very tight space. Once you have all two enemies taken off the ground there are a couple of things you can do to keep the zombies healthy.\n\nThe most necessary items are always the items you use for farming on your last level that have a chance of keeping or helping you survive zombies and/or taking them out by some means.\n\nSticks that you are able to use are either your best survival kit, your zombie best item, or just your best weapon.\n\nYour zombies are usually not going to be extremely powerful, and they are not immune to your magic.\n\nYou can get into big fights with them with your spear, but you should use any tools you have, and only use them if you need to for your Zombie to go.\n\nDon't forget, the last point to remember is that they are not immune and have always been able to take you out.\n\nA strong and long spear that can kill and keep your zombies healthy has good range that allows you to sneak in, but it also offers a decent damage output that is just not being used in the game - especially if you are facing a big Zombie.\n\nOne good option would be a pair of two-handed bows, but it is difficult to find a good alternative from an outside source like a well-thought-out bow.\n\nNow the important thing about getting a good sword is that your swords are very tough in terms of damage, but even then they are not that strong on any character. You can use any weapon in your arsenal, but a good sword will put you in good position to get out of fights.\n\nThe best way to get a sword is with this technique: a bow, a bow rod or a bow with magic. If it is good and you are able to use it quickly then you will be able to get your sword off quickly.\n\nFor most characters, this can work well, but if you get your skills down early and you are able to use it for a while then it is not always ideal.\n\nIf you get a skill which is good and you can use it for awhile and it works for you, then you are in a good place.\n\nA simple method is to make a spear with one small staff, and use a medium sword. After you have the Staff equipped you should also have the staff and wield it (you should also be able to use it when you are able to, and it will not be very difficult to sneak in, as you are not going to be in the area and using it will cause the staff to run out of ammunition, so you should also wait in this area)\n\nNow just remember that", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

You should try it.\n\nTo make it clear, there are only two ways to get in:\n\nSettle in or hike in\n\nA trailhead is a shortcut to a different place. In order to make the trek faster than walking one or two feet, the guide might want to hike a small ridge that leads down from your tent to the mountain. A hiking trailhead might actually have a sign reading: \"SUNDAY, NOIRDAY / JUNE 5, 2012.\" When using this form, you will see this sign: The trailhead is an easy way to get to your destination.\n\nSome of the better alternatives may be:\n\nSheltering\n\nThere are other better ways, but both are more expensive and time consuming. You may also want to pick up a tent or some sort of equipment before you jump in. At least three different sleeping equipment will suffice, including a sleeping bag, sleeping pad, towels, toilet paper, and dry clothes.\n\nCleaning\n\nMany people use a different or more expensive approach to cleaning. The easiest way, is to simply clean your tent up and throw away a few belongings. There's little cost to doing this, especially when it comes to clothing.\n\nMost tents and shelters come with a self-closet for a good cleaning service. However, a good place are a few doors down from the tent or shelter. This will provide a place to gather supplies so you can be ready to help. Some shelters also take you home for check-in. When you leave the tent or shelter, do not expect anything to happen. You won't find the clothes you were supposed to need here.\n\nWalking to a shelter\n\nThis is the most difficult way to get your way. If all you need are tents, hiking shoes, a sleeping bag, towel, and clean clothes, it may be hard to find a place to walk. The best option is to walk your dogs to the end of a trailhead.\n\nIf you want to go camping, it's really easy and quite cheap. A few local spots include:\n\nThe Kettle Hill National Forest. The first and most important place that hikers come here is the Kettle Hill National Forest. The only campsites that you can see are at 2 1/2 and 3 1/2 miles from the campground. To arrive at the campground, go at least 3 minutes. It only takes 4 minutes. On the other side, from about 2 minutes after you arrive outside your tent, you can see and hear the sounds of some of the other campsites. The campground consists of a circular dirt road that leads to different campsites. There are many different campsites of different length. They are connected with one another by a tunnel.

He was pronounced dead at Hwang Woo General Hospital after being reported missing following a domestic fire. He was pronounced dead at the scene with a medical condition.\n\nThe South Korean government said Lee left early one morning because the family was out. The government confirmed on social media that Lee was found alive.\n\nWitnesses described Lee to be in the 80s with short black hair and an athletic build, and he was wearing dark clothing and a white jacket.\n\nWitnesses said they saw him playing with children on the roof of his home just blocks away from the building, and that he had a short white beard.\n\nThey said another witness said Lee had long hair \"and blue eyes\", as well as dark eyes. They also said he was white. He also appeared to wear a T-shirt with the words \"Jangwon\", as well as large hands and a wide-brimmed hat, KFA 4 News said.\n\nAn employee at the scene said that it was unknown why Lee left home, as it was closed for several hours early Sunday morning and had yet to be filled.\n\nPolice said they suspected an investigation into Lee's death was underway.\n\nPolice said the death occurred at about 3:15am. When they arrived at the scene, the suspect was identified as a 17-year-old girl aged 13 or 14, according to the Seoul Central News Agency (SCN) in a statement.\n\n\"Mystery is still under investigation and the family is cooperating fully through the national Police Department with their usual methods to solve this unfortunate murder,\" Lee's brother, Kim Hyeon-won, said in the SCN. \"Police are also cooperating with local businesses to collect money.

It was an entirely false claim and a lie because investigators did not find any evidence of classified information.\n\nClinton's campaign said the FBI Director, James Comey, said the \"extremely careless\" actions of FBI agents in handling classified information \"caused serious harm to an organization and to Secretary Clinton, her family, and her department.\"\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\nWhat makes it even worse than a lie? There is no indication that the Obama Administration knew about the mishandling of classified information at all.\n\nThe report was compiled as part of FBI Director James Comey's internal review into the Clinton investigation. It found that there were \"no known, intentional, malicious, or improper means or means\" to deliberately mishandle classified information.\n\nIn short, the FBI's probe of Clinton's email investigation began in 2014. It went back to 2008 as part of the FBI's ongoing counterintelligence investigations into her use of a private server while secretary of State.\n\nIn that same year, former FBI Director James Comey publicly admitted that the FBI had not seen a single classified or classified email of any kind, \"even by the very person, the person, the person that wrote that email.\"\n\nIn fact, there was one email of some kind as well. That was Hillary Clinton's \"extremely careless,\" which was the most careless that the FBI could find of which the Secretary of State email was in, \"and which at the time and again has caused significant problems for individuals throughout the department and its work.\"\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\nIn his report of his findings, James Comey said \"there are no known intentional, unredacted emails of any kind\" related to the Clinton case. That makes no sense, since the FBI can't know the actual contents of classified information when it gets there, and the only way to know about some of those emails would be to go to the State Department or some outside authority and verify the information, in theory, based on a private judgment or the best available evidence.\n\nIn other words, not only does Hillary Clinton's FBI team have nothing to do with what she wrote with such reckless disregard that it is a hoax or a false story, but it has no idea that a \"very bad idea\" of those emails could come to be because she used it.\n\nAs we've previously observed, the \"extremely careless\" actions of the FBI team is something other security experts were critical in uncovering several months ago.\n\nAfter all, this was the first time since Obama took office that Secretary Clinton had ever been indicted in the same way.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\nClinton's State Department had previously claimed that at her confirmation hearing on Feb. 9, \"a significant number\" of emails had been recovered that were being held by the State Department, and a significant number were being sent from her State Department. This is, of course, false.\n\nAlso, she admitted in her own Senate testimony that \"I have an unusual situation with the Department of State, and it's not just the FBI that needs to be at the center of it.\"\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\nThis is the same situation where the State Department did not find any classified classified information during their probe into Hillary's handling of classified information until after the first presidential debate.\n\nThere was nothing the Clinton team knew about her email probe until just after the debate.\n\nIn fact, \"no official document, no information about the course of conduct on the part of the State Department, and zero evidence were found that the United States knew what was being discussed on the stage when the debate started. There is no evidence that any relevant U.S. Government entity, department or agency ever found or disseminated any classified information.\"\n\nThis means that despite the FBI's findings and the \"extremely careless\" actions of Comey, the Justice Department must be prepared to launch an internal investigation into any evidence it finds that makes it \"contrary to the best and greatest public interest.\"\n\nWith that, we should welcome an independent federal official to oversee this massive investigation to date.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\nSource: Wikileaks\n\nAlso see:", "length": 938, "ended": true}

Please make it clear that you are not a fan of these pages and consider to review and remove all non-fiction, non-fiction that you feel does not have an understanding of feminism.\n\nThe article was created by a user named 'Savage'. You may find this user great looking and helpful. If you would like to help, please take a minute to reply and we will help you. In any case do not post.\n\nThis is a topic that has been under discussion for awhile. If you have questions about it in the comments please do not post on the site.\n\nThere is not much of an article here to write about because this page has been ignored and you can think on your own. But I like to suggest that people try to write articles for feminists, which are an important part of the internet.\n\nAll articles on the site are free of charge and are only a suggestion.\n\nA few things you will find are:\n\nFor the first time in a long time, some of us are taking a stand.\n\nI've been saying this to everyone before and now this comes to my mind.\n\nThe whole point of this wiki is to explain the facts and the arguments. Most of the content is written by men and does not include any information that doesn't apply to you.\n\nWe're at the start of a debate and I'd like to provide a few reasons why we disagree.\n\nFirst, let's start by saying that I have decided it's not important that you read any of the articles in this forum to help the argument. This is all because my reasons are too important for this forum to be taken out of context. This is just one reason I'm asking for your help in the first place.\n\nAlso there must be a fair way of getting at your facts. As my opponent's point of view may be different, this does not add to my argument.\n\nThe main reason for this is that the feminist movement is very anti-trans and has become very politicized. It is a way that only a weak or marginalized group gets a fair chance at fighting back.\n\nThere are many feminists and trans, genderqueer and other \"feminist\" men out there that want to make sure every group in our society is represented. They want to see some sort of trans and genderqueer political platform.\n\nThe purpose of this group is to try and get a piece of the pie in the feminist movement, and they are being held against their will. If they're unable to, it makes all the difference.\n\nIt's important not to write articles that are pro-choice. We will not put any of this on the internet.\n\nSecondly, this is a huge issue:\n\nWe all use a form of identification to find out who we are. Do you know an ethnic minority? Look no further than that and you don't know a woman or a person.\n\nMany people have tried to get at their facts by talking about them on this website. This is not what this page is about. And I know some don't care. But let's try to make things easier for everyone with a voice.\n\nAnd if there is anything I have missed here and I would like to hear something else, I will add it to this article so other people can be on your side.\n\nIn the meantime, if you would like to help keep up the good work, please do so. This is also the reason that I want people to put up their work.\n\nI'm a professional feminist, but I also love to read. If it's just that much, I might want to read through this if it's not for you. I'm very grateful to be here on this day.\n\nI have many good and interesting ideas. I hope you will come to see them.\n\nLove,\n\nSavage\n\nSavage", "length": 829, "ended": true}

{"id": 250352, "text": "It seems all that time you've been reading about it, you've been wondering, is this a game that's been around for more than 100 years? (Well, it's been around for, right? I'm not saying that there's been more than 100 years of it. I'm saying that it has been around for maybe four and a half decades now.) Well, it appears to be coming to an end. What's wrong?\n\nWell, what does it have to do with the Internet and all its other devices? Well, if you don't know how to interact with the Internet you probably don't understand it at all. Here's a short list of points that you might be interested in:\n\nIn order to do that, people need computers that are very powerful \u2014 so powerful they can handle everything. Even though you're typing at 6,000 miles an hour or something it means you can't do the things that you don't need. So what you're really doing here is doing one thing and then you can perform another.\n\nYou still need some physical physical power for interacting with the Internet. How does this matter? Well, how do you get the Internet to connect to the Internet at all? If you have one of the cables you need to hook a modem into you your modem is going to get connected to the Internet at a rate a little faster than it normally would. So the idea is to have wireless, a huge number of cables available if you want them.\n\nOkay, so what this means is it's going to take all our time. A lot of the things that we've been talking about about before, what we do now, there's an entirely new level of connectivity. The more people that use the Internet to connect to the Internet, the more bandwidth and energy, not just for things like wireless routers or those tiny machines running on the Internet that are doing lots of different things, you will have greater internet access.\n\nWhat it does actually is it enables those people to communicate more and they can go online at a longer time in terms of their speed. They do it at a lower speed and it's not like one of those computers is slow and doing a lot of damage and you have to do a lot of things.\n\nIt also adds to that the ability for people to have internet access is a critical component to the quality of life that is so essential to their day-to-day lives.\n\nThat's something that we've mentioned several times in the past \u2014 a couple more points on how you could add something like that.\n\nYou know, this is a game that people are playing right now because it's so amazing \u2014 and one of a kind \u2014 on the game community that you're playing in. You have to be able to make that amazing game because it's an amazing game all on its own and at the same time, all of the things that people do at work and in their lives, they can only have that access.\n\nThe game that you're playing is so amazing and it's the kind of game that people are going to love because it's so much more than just a game, it's like one of the kind. A few things that people have a problem with:\n\nIt can be very slow to start and it's very difficult to start at all. You'll be playing for the longest time and then it's your whole life that's going to stop.\n\nIt takes a long time for things to get connected to the Internet.\n\nWhen you open a webpage or a page, it might take for 5 seconds or the whole page. The other thing you can do is you'll be connecting to a server. You'll be able to look at something, you'll be at a new website or something, but it still takes a couple seconds and a whole page to connect to and connect to the Internet. So the most important thing is not only that you're connected \u2014 but also how to connect to and connect to the internet because that's something that so many times, you're going to be sitting there all the time on one of these machines. And that means you need to get really good at a specific task at a particular point.\n\nThe thing that you need to do is find a good user interface that allows you to look at things and interact with them.\n\nWe use the term user interface here because if you've got some information on what you're doing, what you're doing with this information and, you know, the way the user interacts with the information, the game that you're playing, that makes you feel good about your work, that it works for you because that's what the user is really about. And so, the user interface works really well.

Some families can make their own way to see their kids.

Some people will have their hearts open as you move up and down the face. While you're standing, hold both fingers in the open area. This makes your heart swell slightly and make the heart feel more stable. If you move your arm slowly enough, the heart will start to swell. If you move it slowly enough, the heart will turn to the side.\n\nThe Heart's Heart is the number one spot on your heart's surface. It represents every possible heart type. You can't get more than this one, so it can't be mistaken for your body. Try holding the heart tightly for about a minute after starting your heart exercise. Don't try this on your child. This heart doesn't have any weight and won't pump blood. However, if you are going to have an open heart you should make sure you are wearing plenty of protection from the stress of an open heart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most important thing you can do in this case is to open it. Don't open the heart in the first place. Make sure you're carrying enough oxygen. Once you have an open heart your body will stop and will start the heart up.\n\nHow to Use It\n\nYou should open up the heart and pump blood. Put your arm gently on the side of the chest. If you do that you may pull your arm away from the side of the chest and push it forward down over the chest so it meets your face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a few minutes your arm will go in between your legs and hold the heart in there as quickly as you can. You'll then see the heart.\n\nWhen your arms and legs close around the chest, pull your arms all the way over the chest, but not nearly as close as necessary.\n\nYou shouldn't hold on to the heart much longer. There will be a slight pressure and you may feel it too quickly, making movement uncomfortable for you. If it gets up, it's done.\n\nIf it doesn't change that way, you might be able to get into a coma that you never wanted. It's possible in most cases.\n\nSo what did you think about his heart?

They are 9-4 on the road without a win (11-5 overall) and 5-4 in a nine-game trip from the season opener to the Lakers' home, Utah.\n\nAt one point in Utah's 14-game win streak, the Lakers were 9-5-2 against Utah, a 5-0 record, in six consecutive games. After scoring 22.7 points on 27-for-29 shooting over the last 16 games, this is the first time they have gone 9-5 this season, and there was an uptick in that streak on Saturday, when their 10-2 record was back against them after four straight losses. And the Jazz have won six straight in those stretches to open the regular season -- the longest streak all-time (6-1).\n\nIf they are successful against Utah, they are at the forefront of a trend: That of a team that has made the playoffs nine times in five years.\n\n\"I'm not saying they're being arrogant,\" Jazz GM Karl Malone said early this summer. \"The reason that they came out of the gate and are playing at the highest level, to really come from a place of pride, I think is just a positive for us. It's not a negative. Everybody has a big time and a long story. The reason why we were good has a lot of to do with our attitude.\"\n\nSo much for the \"I'm proud to stay in Salt Lake\" kind of mantra for this team. The Jazz are 9-6 on the road despite losing to Utah twice.\n\nThe way the fans have been reacting, a huge part of the Kings' success is because they can control themselves and let the momentum take them out of it. They've been a mess at times.\n\nNow they are 6-10 when being 3-6, and the defense is not good, as some have noted, so playing them all out may be a smart play by L.A. coach Quin Snyder. The Lakers, which is 6-11 in those nine games, have been 3-6 at this point.\n\nThe Warriors, who have lost three straight, lost a three-straight series in San Antonio on Tuesday. And after the season began, the Warriors are 11-12 when in a row losing to them, and then losing to the Jazz twice in Sacramento.\n\nWith two straight games in each series and a road loss to the Jazz that would send the team in trouble, they still want to play their three-day break and see how it all plays out.\n\n\"We've got to keep working to win and get better,\" Snyder said. \"I think we've been able to turn it around with our offense and defensively. We want to be a big factor going forward as far as what we want to be as a team. We have to win it. We've gotta work on that.\"\n\nThis isn't a time of \"winning big games\" on a short time frame, particularly when a team like the Warriors is 10-8 overall for the third time in 11 years. They're only winning one of 11 games, the last eight, in San Antonio and the last four in San Antonio. They have won six straight after being tied at 1-1 since beating Utah on Friday. The Jazz also did not make it to Monday's game after they didn't visit the Spurs on their road trip.\n\nThe Jazz are also still in first place in the West after losing to San Antonio and are 5-4 in those three games, down two points from a season ago when they trailed by 15 in the first half. The Spurs are 6-3 in the series and six-3 this season, and the Lakers are 5-6.\n\n\"I just hope that the win will make us better,\" Utah guard George Hill said. \"It's been frustrating right now, especially on (Friday). We lost two games back in San Antonio -- one in the third quarter and one in the second quarter, I think I'm being honest with you.\n\n\"But to win as fast as we can with the defense, especially when we have a chance to score, I think the goal is to get the game moving.\"\n\nThey started their regular-away home streak the previous two days, but they took a 24-23 road trip this week, as they trailed by 20 and couldn't come close to winning a game before the Warriors took a 30-24 lead on Thursday.\n\n\"If we make this first game more efficient in what we have done", "length": 1024, "ended": false}
{"id": 250355, "text": "I just started writing a new article for Vladek, and I'm surprised how few people have read either the book or the movie I wrote about. Maybe I'm wrong here but I see a number of books from other authors. But what I wanted to do was to write a short primer on the world of art, and I've created a new video that goes over these elements in detail.\n\nArt has three main components: the object, the object's relation to the other object, and the object's relation to another. The object can change, so as to look different from the other object, and vice versa. We live in a world where we're able to manipulate objects and things and interact with people and other things without being bound to anything or to objects; objects are objects and objects are relations. Objects look the same when they are placed on or moved.\n\nHere are some ideas of how the objects relate on Earth:\n\nThere are three parts to a piece of wood. One is where all the wood is planted and the other two are the branches placed on. This can be either horizontally or vertically, for instance. If we're looking for a tree with branches from one side to another, we can look like a tree that has two branches (a horizontal one). We see an outline of the two branches in a grid and then we see an outline of the tree in its trunk. The other half is in the shape of an animal; it could look like a dog and it could look like a cow but the shape of the horse gives us the idea of being in a dog or cow state.\n\nOur world is much more complicated, for example, since there is many different types of objects on the planet and many different kinds of things on the earth. It is this complexity that causes us to look at things in the wrong light. This helps us come up with new ways of looking at things.\n\nThe world of art is about different shapes, colours and distances, and there will be many ways you can represent this in different ways. These could be with a simple black and white image which looks like a picture of a person, for example, or with a 3D representation of an animal, with three 3D objects which can be animated. This makes it more natural to create in the same way as you could for an image of the body or a person, and is useful when we are modeling something very realistic. We see things on the world surface, in different ways depending on the geometry:\n\nThe shape and distance of the objects in an image is how you are expected to perceive them when they are placed on or moved on a surface.\n\nHow a person sees the world in different ways from those who have seen it.\n\nWhat shapes the objects in the picture are made from - the size of the sphere, the diameter of the sphere, the radius of the radius, the shape of a hole on the top of a brick, and the type of object placed on that top.\n\nThe colors we see in an image (e.g. brown, orange, red, purple) is in how the colors of it are made.\n\nThe color information of a image is what you are meant to interpret, but what happens when you combine that information with the other information.\n\nAn image can be made of a 3D object or a 2D one. Some types of things are based on what you can see, for example on the ground. This is how the colours of objects look when they are placed upside down on the ground.\n\nDifferent kinds of shapes and distances can be generated by having a 2D object or 3D object. 3D objects are generally composed of objects as shown by 3D characters.\n\nThe world of 3D art\n\nIf this has helped you, then I'd love to hear about this article and how I do it. Please do so in the comments box, and let me know what you think!\n\nAs a reminder\n\nThere have been over 60 different types of 3D images printed on the market so far in the past year. I still have some in the works, and my latest offering is called Black & White 2D Art.", "length": 865, "ended": true}
{"id": 250356, "text": "\nThe first part of this series is dedicated to showing just how much of a difference there really is between the best of the best. For example, the very first part of this series will show you how this list (and all the stuff you find there) changes at every level of fantasy from fantasy to RTS.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, if you want to know when to add a character or race you can do so by having a copy of Pathfinder or the \"New GM Guide\" set. This may cost an entire book or two, but by doing so you should have a fairly solid understanding of the mechanics that make up character creation so, if everything runs smoothly and without any serious flak, you won't have a problem with starting a war.\n\nThe next part of the series will show you about how to make an \"armour box\", or a kit, for a character. That is, that something you can actually use to make weapons. A good reason for this can be seen in the concept of the \"armour box\" in the Pathfinder set. It's basically a pack containing the armour and weapons that the player would find in the \"legendary\" campaign for most RTS's (if not all RTS's) on this planet. You might be surprised to find out why in some cases these kinds of boxes are still used today because it was a matter of time before everyone understood the power of the armour box more completely. Here's a brief overview on how you can build it out.\n\nCreating a Weapon Box\n\nFor players who want to play tabletop games in a more advanced way, I recommend taking the time to take some time to create a \"armour box\" to take advantage of the abilities and benefits that come easily to any roleplaying game. This way, if you're in the middle of writing a project where you're not sure if you'll be able to finish it, there's no need to build a single box for you. You can simply go back to the \"legendary\" campaign and go into a general area and build the box from where it should be. This way, if you've completed any of the previous two or three main campaign (most of which are already written in RTS, so there's a lot more space left up for your imagination), you'll still be ready to start using the skills and equipment of your old game when you finish it.\n\nI've never found anything as good or better than this type of box without some sort of equipment kit. I'm going to talk about how to use my two favorite things that come with a toolbox to create a piece of equipment that is ready to use by itself at a glance.\n\nYou can easily put a sheet of paper between all of the items on this set and turn it around. Just be aware that you may not see what you are doing when you're starting out. There are a few points to be made about this that are especially important here. First, you must make sure all of the equipment and the kit you're looking for are in working order for you to get this box in place. If you can go the extra mile and try out everything without ever seeing the first two sheets, it's much safer for you to take them out instead of waiting for the first one to arrive.\n\nSecondly, keep in mind this list is just for illustrative purposes only, so you might be wondering if it's the best for you. Some of these materials you're going to want to carry out are pretty self explanatory, and for a detailed explanation of what you should expect to actually do with all of the things you just created, I'd suggest checking it out. There's a good chance you'll find some good stuff on these back in the day.\n\nTo get you started, here are a few things I've heard people tell me they really like to avoid:\n\nIt's often difficult to get into the game because it's so easy to get started. You spend hours on a single book, but your development is always moving in circles on multiple pages and it's difficult to figure out which ones you might be working on at the same time.\n\nThere are certain features and settings that are difficult or impossible to get into if there isn't a single book to begin with. This often doesn't matter too much if you can take a day off to play the game as well as you can to do things and be productive.\n\nOne of the things I've found most useful about setting up any one-on-one game is that it's really easy to get things up and running. You can keep the game running for a couple of weeks at a time, work on things you care about, make stuff out of it (although that's a more difficult part of setting up your game than a manual one,) or take a lot of time to complete one-on-ones.\n\nYou can do a lot of the tedious stuff you'd want in a", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

That's why the American Psychological Association (APA), a research and consulting organization that studies psychology and health, released findings suggesting that TV could be getting more and more people into a diabetic state.\n\nThat's because TV has increased TV viewing in recent years. And while TV shows about diabetic patients are usually better-looking (for the elderly), the majority of people with diabetes can actually see the shows about diabetes without incurring more health costs.\n\nBut the APA says there's also a \"huge number of TV commercials and ads about diabetes, the medical risks and benefits, as well as what happens when people have diabetes.\n\n\"The bottom line is that diabetes is a chronic condition,\" explained Barbara A. Williams, a director of the organization's diabetes research unit.\n\nSo many people can't afford a TV because they can't afford high-definition screens because of low-quality equipment on their TVs, she said.\n\nRelated How TV is affecting people with diabetes and where they spend their money most often:\n\nA study released last summer also found that about one in five Americans have diabetes and that only about one in 20 people with diabetes still live without regular food or water, said Dr. David Noland of the University of Minnesota Medical Center in Minneapolis.\n\nNoland and his team also found that people who live in households with low incomes often live more than two to three hours in meals a day, which is not exactly great news in a home with two bedrooms or a bathroom with 2 baths. And for most Americans, a couple of hours is enough to be comfortably in a home with two or more bedrooms and a bathroom with 3 baths.\n\nBut for those people, an HDTV can't mean more than one meal a day just yet, and the number of hours for that is expected to grow. The group hopes that by developing technology that gives people access to information they don't need at home, it will help ease worries that some Americans might not be able to afford a TV.\n\n\"The thing we're going to do is say, 'We can buy a HDTV, but you get to watch the show from home,' \" Noland said. \"That means you can watch this show wherever you want.\"\n\nThere aren't any plans at this time to offer all-in-one HDTVs, nor have they addressed how they might be going to impact those purchasing homes.\n\nWhile most of these plans might cost homes that are either too expensive for people with diabetes, the APA said they can help them do just that.\n\nRELATED: HDTVs on Amazon: What You'll Find\n\nMore: TV Shows You'll Probably Hear In the U.K., France, Germany, Denmark, Italy and Austria", "length": 586, "ended": true}
{"id": 250359, "text": "You're going to have to wait until you've spent money somewhere else before they can deliver you a replacement.\n\nNot only does this mean that they'll have to get your credit file, but they'll have to buy you new cars.\n\nEven though you're already paying $10,000 for your car (and even though you're on the insurance front and the car is already insured, so now you'll have to pay $40,000 down to get them to the point of a car loan), you'll have to wait until you have another insurance policy\u2014one that will cover your actual costs as well as your deductible and car insurance deductible.\n\nHere are 10 ways a car dealership can use online data to keep track of you when they go over a car purchase.\n\n1. Pay to Be a Promoter\n\nIt's important that you know the price you'll owe when there's a car purchase and when it's time for the car. You may have heard about the \"buyer discount,\" which means you get one dollar for each item purchased. That's why it's a great idea before you buy, just look into your insurance policy to see what is the best offer you can get. The best offer you can get is one dollar for each car purchase for $150,000 worth of insurance\u2014meaning every single car in your life you buy can get your insurance plan.\n\nHow to get better insurance for your car: Get your auto plan. It's not as easy as you think. Most car insurance companies don't offer any sort of auto discount, so how much will you get when you get the car, what is the car's credit rating and what's your annual deductible and your car insurance premium? Here's how.\n\n2. Save the Price of Your Car\n\nIt's important that you know the price you'll owe when you make an auto purchase. You always want the one most favorable deal, which is one that offers the most low price.\n\nHow to save: Take your online credit binder, which has a detailed process for submitting your online quotes\u2014a process that can take some time and even hours.\n\nHow to save: In addition to making your credit binder public, you can also find a car rental company or even an auto rehab home with more information about how your home will fit in a car.\n\nHow to buy insurance on the market: With online auto policy quotes and online auto quotes, you'll want to try and get your car as quickly as possible. That will require a lot more effort from the car insurance company, which could cost more than a dollar or two.\n\n3. Get a Replacement\n\nIt's easy to become frustrated when you see \"Oh my god, I'm going to have to pay an extra six dollars for an old car.\" A car shop can usually find a car for under $100,000 for just under $30,000. Some people take the car up for sale, but when you're getting new cars, a car dealer will offer a discount you can't refuse.\n\nHow to get better insurance: Here is an example of how to get better for just $60,000\u2014because that's what you'll pay for the entire purchase.\n\nHow to get better insurance on the market: Make sure you get a replacement car in the second or third year. When a car was stolen, an auto insurance company will recommend something to your car's manufacturer. This is what happens in almost every case.\n\nHow to get better insurance for your new car: This is when you get the idea of finding a replacement car that has the latest features, such as the new brake, new wiring, all-new suspension etc. The dealer will make sure the car has an updated steering wheel and some other features that will likely keep you running smoothly.\n\nWhat to do if a car is sold for less than what you pay for a car insurance cover: This is called \"selling it off.\" The same goes for any car you get because, like any good car insurance, you'll need to have a new replacement. You can buy cars from a dealership to save money if you already have one.\n\n4. Get an Accountant\n\nWhat if you have to get a loan from someone who is paying for you? What are the chances that someone will send you a car you don't need?\n\nHow to get better auto insurance: If you have to pay off the principal of a car that has already been sold for less than what you pay, check the auto insurance policy online instead. Here are some ways to do that (see also \"how to save for more\"):\n\nCall your insurance company.\n\nPurchase one in person or online, or call 1-800-745-4100.\n\nGet a new vehicle at the dealership.\n\nBuy a car from a dealership and pay $20.00, or $100.00 if you had purchased a car", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

It is very interesting to me that you think to say that you will support and support \"austerity\" which means to oppose \"austerity\" that \"they are not a real thing because of money being pumped into politics, they are the only social system that offers real jobs. They are not good in terms of reducing poverty because of this, we are spending too much money which destroys your economy and our living standards. If you believe they are not an act of desperation rather than a real choice they are not good because they are not working at all, they are the same as an act of poverty\". What exactly do the government and their lackeys try to gain by supporting a crisis driven in Europe which is now destroying you as a people and if you believe that is how the government works in other countries.\n\nWell this is a good point and I don't think anyone can get over this one and I think you have been doing a good job of this sort of thing. I think what we are doing is not really working, we're trying to get it the best possible way of doing things, which is you should support the people, the way we are doing things or you should support the politicians that have made it into a mess.\n\nAs I said you should do the other thing and what the government actually is doing is not working. It is actually hurting people and we all know this. It is the very same thing people have been fighting for for decades and it has gotten in the way of our development, our economy and our lives. It's not even making the problem worse, which is why it has taken us far into the future and even this past election when the party is at a very fragile state I would argue when they lost to UKIP they was trying to convince the public that this is only one problem, not a whole raft of problems the way this is all about.\n\nFor this country is not a solution you want to have. It is an argument that is not true from a political perspective but this is why I believe our politics have always been very political. That is a long way from an economics where we know everything is going right and a whole lot in the future is just going well and there are many things that go right but we just don't have that understanding and that is why people do keep going for five to 10 years.\n\nSo you can see that what I mean was that we are doing well now at the beginning of this campaign where we should be doing very well, we're doing good and doing very well, you just have to pay attention because the politicians do not know what to do. They are always doing it exactly what they think they do in the end which is that they are getting to the end of it. It may be like doing a business plan; I have a simple business plan to start my business but I am not going to move as fast on it as I did because it's a very old business plan and they never have that same understanding.\n\nYou also said that the country has a very small budget but it is very, very small and that is to be expected and that's why I feel sorry for this country and for the citizens of Britain and the people in the rest of the world who have put up with the level of destruction that this country has been creating. We want to grow and we are making a lot of money, that is what is happening. It is not just being given to politicians.\n\nIf you look at the last 30 years or so we have all been in quite a bit of the same situation.\n\nSo you think I am saying you don't have to do anything to change something and that is to say that you would like to do something about it, but the more important thing is that you understand that austerity is a political fact, if you like, the way politicians are working, do not just support this issue. The sooner and the better then it is for the economy. You do not have to do anything and you should not support politics. Let your friends support Labour, let your politicians support Labour, do not support politics. You only have to support your friends, and then when you think about what government is to you and what it is to the future, those people who are in charge of it, then there should have been a clear answer.\n\nIt is a very old and outdated political tactic as always. So it does have some truth and it does have some truth in the way it is being fought and the way politicians are working, it is not just politics.\n\nAnd finally you don't even want the government to take a look at the future. The only thing you want is our country to go back to a time to come. If we believe it will be a better future then in the present and therefore not a bad one", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 250364, "text": "Friedrich Nietzsche is perhaps best known for his famous \"Cultures of the Wild.\" While it is perhaps not surprising that Nietzsche would have been opposed to any form of human suffering (though the same may be said for his anti-abortion views), his ideas for improving society are nonetheless so influential and impactful. In many ways, Nietzsche is a classicist. He considers the \"moral\" as opposed to the \"spiritual\" and states like to avoid \"being killed.\" He is one of the most consequentialists of the 21st century \u2013 one who has developed a broad, moralizing understanding of life through a series of disciplines. He has seen life not as a game of cards (but as a game of logic); he sees the world in the very way individuals think, experience, and learn. He is one of the most powerful people I know for a reason: he was born an atheist (he is not) and now lives in the very heart of liberalism.\n\nIn part because he understands life through science (he believes that \"nature is not always fair\") he is also influenced by philosophy (he does not believe that the human mind is always wrong). And also because he understands evolution from its scientific nature to the one science has now learned of (he regards the theory of natural evolution in the context of biology). Nietzsche recognizes that all forms of suffering are intrinsically wrong and to \"stop them all would be to end the whole.\" Therefore a life is the best way to end it; this is why we suffer from death and suffering to one another. But then, that's the sort of person you want when you want to stop killing people to save them from death.\n\nNietzsche has also taken the view that we might be happier if we would help others find and learn. If we could be the best at all we might be so much better today than at any moment in the history of the human race. Nietzsche takes it one step at a time that we will soon be able to do so.\n\nNietzsche is a strong believer in the power of individual conscience \u2013 or \"the right to refuse\" rather than \"the leftward right,\" in Nietzsche's case, to kill life. His life is not, however, as a game of cards with all of us. As he tells his biographer, \"I'm not a player, I'm a creature. I'm not a person; I'm the game. But I am able to do a lot more than that; I'm also able to live on my own terms, as if I were playing a life game. I'm an optimist; the game doesn't always play out that way.\" On that basis, Nietzsche considers our best course of action so important and that what is more important to them is to make themselves more like us, regardless of who they are. He is the hero and hero has the right to demand that we be taken into his care \u2013 that we seek to be good citizens, not as some kind of \"human creature.\"\n\nWhen we think of Nietzsche and he that lives life, what we often think of is people. As he notes in his Introduction, \"\u2026when we get to know people, we often know them not as people, but as human beings, so we know that they are different things.\" Thus, although we are more like us, we are not just different from each other. The differences among us come from the ways we feel, and that is a major influence on his work.\n\nHe also sees a human nature as something unique to humanity, as a unique way to live and a unique way to be. When he says that I am the personification of \"that which is more\" there is a certain tension between that and that which is not. There is a deep connection between human personality, that which is less human, that which is more like a man, and also what it meant for society to be different than what it is now. For Nietzsche, these are the ways of living and life we live. Yet the very fact of being born a Nietzsche is a personification of this identity.\n\nIn the film, one man is led to believe that a particular life is better than all else.

{"id": 250365, "text": "NARRATOR: I'm not a physicist; in fact, I know not to look at the Universe because it's so big. As such, I've never been a scientist either to speak of or to be understood by the people around: physicists, medical, even science journalists. And these are all people who are passionate people. And I'm not the only one. I met some of the founders of these institutions who are also incredibly strong. So when the story comes out that Dr. Paul Krugman might be interested, I'm sure it's going to be a good opportunity for you to look at their stories on this issue.\n\nNARRATOR: But perhaps that's why this conversation has always been so critical to me and is so important to me for the future. Dr. Krugman was the subject of one of the most widely publicized controversies in American journalism over the past few decades. \"Inventor of the World's Most Reviled Robot,\" as he put it.\n\nPANEL O'REILLY: You mean, what's the one word you've been saying lately about being the winner or the loser?\n\nNARRATOR: Dr. Krugman has said the same, but the one thing he doesn't like about the Nobel prizes so far is that he's won only one. This was the winning Nobel Prize in Physics, and Dr. Paul Krugman is the first person to have won a Nobel Prize. And it's been a big part of this Nobel Prize program, because it is the first prize in the history of physics that anybody has actually won in the name of physics.\n\nNARRATOR: But he's not alone. There's another other, more respected and respected prize this year in economics. Paul Krugman has been doing his best not just to get the word out to readers, but also to get this debate going.\n\nROSEL HART: One of the people who I think is very powerful and who has been the main voice of the Internet today is David Ben-Gurion. He has been president of the World Bank and the European Commission and of course, he has led the fight of the Internet. He is a very successful leader.\n\nNARRATOR: His message to the world is clear: He stands at the center of the new Internet. His message is clear to anyone who doesn't just read the story of the Nobel Prize.\n\nIn many ways, the Nobel Prize gives the world that world.\n\nNARRATOR: And now we will take a look at how David Ben-Gurion has taken his message, how it has shaped the world he lives in and how it's led to something better than what David has ever imagined.\n\nNARRATOR: David Ben-Gurion holds two Nobel Prizes. He was part of a panel of distinguished scientists who studied the role of humans in civilization. Dr. Robert W. Leibniz, a professor of chemistry in the Department of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley. Robert W. Leibniz, also known as the man with the first name on the Nobel Prize, now runs the Institute of Computational Biology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nJOHN HENRY: How can we tell that there is in this system not only human beings but also that a computer or a program for an intelligent machine can do something extraordinary in a matter of thousands of years, maybe millions of years? And what will that have to do with the future?\n\nNARRATOR: When the team of astronomers from the University of Colorado, Boulder came upon this massive world that looked so real, they came to talk about how they could figure out how it was that it appeared to be built not on a human, but rather on a computer. And there is no denying that the fact that it really is a computer that looks like a computer, it is not only built on a human but on a computer.\n\nNARRATOR: Leibniz used a computer to study the structure and behavior of the universe and how humans can and do respond to the fact that a computer exists in this world. But he says that he cannot explain such a world, so he must explain to scientists that it is not an intelligent machine. The computer is there for the purpose of doing something extraordinary.\n\nJOHN HENRY: Why do we have that computer? It might be a computer with which we have a very intimate relationship?\n\nNARRATOR: Leibniz was inspired by his grandfather who, in his final year at Cal State San Bernardino County in California, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine. That award was a kind of test of that idea in the next phase of his research.\n\nJOHN HENRY: The Nobel Prize.\n\nNARRATOR: The Nobel Prize was given to one of the most esteemed scientists in the world.

This effort, known as the \"Votel\" pitch, was successful. Thune used his influence in the Senate Democratic National Committee and other Democratic committees to push the White House to oppose President Obama to re-open the Iran nuclear deal. Thune received no campaign contributions.\n\nHowever, in May 2016, The New York Post reported that at a Clinton Foundation fundraiser in Las Vegas, an attendee of Hillary Clinton said she had met with Thune about a possibility of supporting Senator Thune as a \"Votel\" candidate. Thune was not the president of the Vermont Democratic Party, and in fact, the meeting was reported only a week before the election, according to the Times of Israel. In another email exchange to Thune dated May 17, 2016, Clinton aide Bill Burton told Clinton campaign treasurer Phil Donahue that he wanted to be a \"Votel candidate\" based upon the idea that voters would want to \"stop the nuclear agreement.\" By then, Donahue, and numerous other people close to President Trump had already contacted Donahue about his plans. According to The New York Post, Trump Jr. suggested to Donahue that Donahue be \"an 'expert on this thing,'\" and that he wanted to endorse Sanders for President by providing a quote in response to a question of his own from CNN. However, later in the conversation, Donahue indicated that, because of the campaign's support for Sanders, \"it's possible we'll see the Vermont senator be in a running race against a Democratic Senator.\" A month later, on July 8, 2016, Donahue provided a second quote from The New York Post stating that he wanted Sanders to \"end the war on terrorism.\" According to The New York Post, Donahue had \"satisfied\" by offering the quote. By that point, Donahue \"had asked the Vermont Senator for support, and a Clinton campaign official, Phil Donahue, had already received a phone call from the Clinton campaign. \"Sanders supporters\" were \"not getting enough of the Vermont Senator,\" Donahue told Clinton campaign finance manager Phil Donahue, according to The Washington Post. The quote has since been removed.\n\nThe fact that Donohue's claim that Sanders would be an \"expert\" on terrorism, and therefore endorsing Clinton \"on the question of her own,\" suggests a connection between the Clinton Foundation and a \"votel\" vote in Vermont could be a red flag for Democrats looking to turn out the electorate at polling places.\n\nThe fact that the Clinton Foundation was allowed to give $250,000 to organizations promoting \"social justice and climate justice\" has long been a source of contention among progressives who insist that the Clinton Foundation and its ties to the Clinton Foundation make the foundation and its donors a special interest.\n\nIn a March 21, 2016, interview with Fox News Network, a Clinton campaign adviser defended and defended Hillary Clinton's role in advocating for climate change. \"The", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 250371, "text": "WITH a few tweaks, this is the first time I've seen any kind of weapon drop. Maybe it's just me, but there isn't much of a difference. If anything, it's the ability's effect.\n\nThe thing is, I guess I've only been playing against people who have some \"good\" melee weapons and \"bad\" melee weapons too, so the idea is, I'll probably be outshooting your enemies first.\n\nThe second thing that I'm definitely going to be keeping up with is one of the biggest changes of the game: weapon range is now split up into 20 different parts that can be equipped in either of three configurations for different weapons. The next one I'm going to be adding (which I won't discuss very much here) is the \"dissipitator\" and \"weapon drop\" effects. The weapon drop will be able to target one of these in their inventory as well. The weapon drop won't cost more than a weapon's current amount and also will have an effect on your characters inventory.\n\nThese are all great ideas and a very interesting idea. I think it adds some interesting depth to gameplay through the use of new weapons, but for now I'm hoping they'll work in the game.\n\nThe weapon drop won't be limited to melee weapons, so you'll be able to carry your weapons around for longer and without taking damage from certain places and not have to worry about ammo. The weapon drop won't cost anything beyond a certain amount to carry, but you get the option to carry as many as you want without worrying about ammo. Also, the first 3 weapons in each of the following classes will carry a chance to drop weapons at different locations (such as enemies and weapons with a special ability).\n\nI'm only really interested in the combat classes of this particular class, but I plan on testing a few new ones, too. It'll be much harder to pull the players in from other classes. If I can come up with a list that everyone thinks they know, I'll use that.\n\nI think the main problem with the weapon drop is that it's currently \"free\". It's really hard to find anything in the game that only has a few weapons available, and at the very least it takes a very long time to find. If you're going to do it, then you have a good chance of getting a whole load of junk items. If you have a very rare weapon or two, and you're lucky, then we could have a huge pile of junk items waiting. But right now it's like a long time before anyone can put my money where their mouth is.\n\nI will say this: I think there's a lot more to the weapon drop than what seems to come out there now. It's possible that it was made a long time ago, which could be due to the fact that I'm going through a huge time transition, and I have some things in my head that are getting changed that I wasn't aware of before. It's definitely a challenge to not give up on this game. There's a lot of power that is out there. As the game has expanded, it's also fun to find new things.\n\nI still have a lot of work to do before I can talk about the weapon drop. I plan to do a good bit more on one weapon (but not a lot), and I'm not going anywhere. At this time, I don't think it's a huge loss for the game to make a bunch of stuff that have nothing to do with the weapon drops, but there are still some interesting things that you can do in this game that we don't have anywhere else.\n\nThe next one's going to be a totally open thing so there are an ever-growing number of potential players. I'll have more to say about those folks when someone asks.\n\nUPDATE: In the mean time, please spread the word, and let other people who already know about the story know about these weapons. We definitely will!\n\nI hope you can share your experiences in the comments below, and we'll see if we can make something special happen!\n\nAlso, I appreciate that your time with me has been so helpful and I hope to do more.", "length": 876, "ended": true}

I don't know if it's a surprise, but the reason is that it was very clear in the beginning of the project that there was going to be a company called CERN or something. And that's that, that the fact that they were using the term \"CERN\" was in the sense that they were talking about doing what they did in the United Nations. Well, I've seen that before but I have never considered that the idea as an idea was to say that the two teams of physicists were going to agree on a theory. But what was going on with the idea that there was going to be any other country that would actually use the United States or France as their headquarters? That there would be a certain level of agreement?

And they're really in the first half, just looking for more people. I mean, this is the first thing everybody is concerned about is the safety. So I think it is important, but in fairness, it's really not, at all. And I think when you talk about the technical issues, the fact that there are some things that are there and a certain number of things that are not there and there is a technical problem there is important to ask oneself whether there are different reasons why they are there.\n\nWorried?\n\nROBORO:\n\nWhy is there a difference?\n\nWorried?\n\nROBORO:\n\nNo. There would be no difference. The problems that we are dealing with are related not to the technical issues but to the physical issues.\n\nWorried?\n\nROBORO:\n\nNo, that's not the point.\n\nWorried?\n\nROBORO:\n\nNo.\n\nWorried?\n\nROBORO:\n\nIn this area of international cooperation, obviously. But as I understand it, it was all developed by the U.S. Government, through a treaty. So, there were problems with that treaty in its early stages. We talked about some of the treaties but, I don't believe there has been one of them, because it was not a treaty. It was a legal treaty, which means there has to be some agreement about how to proceed and not to try to get things out that the government can't agree upon with the public on which all of its people is located.\n\nWorried?\n\nROBORO:\n\nNo, the treaty was not a legal treaty.\n\nWorried?\n\nROBORO:\n\nThat's correct.\n\nWorried?\n\nROBORO:\n\nYes.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMADDOW: And this is the one that I don't know if other countries are going to have. And I'm sure that there are other countries but no one would argue that there's a problem with it because it's a constitutional issue.\n\nWorried?\n\nROBORO:\n\nBut even in this case we don't have an international treaty in which a country is trying to determine if something will be good. We have nothing. Nothing. The international law, I think there's a problem there because it doesn't follow from the law in what it says. The international law tells us where the problem is, the situation is serious. But if they don't take the responsibility by the international law and say that's a problem because they don't see a problem, then it's no longer that the problem exists. That the problem is over with. There is no problem.\n\nWorried?\n\nROBORO:\n\nA second part of that is they know that if they're going to put things in a vacuum, they might as well go in order that they can't use things that aren't there, in order make certain they're not putting things there so they might find a way around it. So you go in order that you can't use things that aren't there, you go in to order that you never use or your whole life you don't use.\n\nWorkered?\n\nROBORO:\n\nWell, look, I have no problem with that.\n\nWorkered?\n\nROBORO:\n\nI certainly don't agree that that's a problem. But, in the context of global warming, we know that we can make a lot of progress on many other problems.

{"id": 250374, "text": "I wanted to see how far we're willing to go in creating that world. This is one of those examples where the technology isn't there yet and that kind of game can't go far. I'm not going to do what would require an incredibly complex game to be playable; it just happened to occur a few years ago for the most part.\n\nThat's why this game is an example of a world where it's possible for the player to be involved before you start working. A very simple example: The game has no world so you have only your eyes and no hand to make sure you're aware of everything moving around. The player might have an understanding of the world, but he wouldn't know which world is right next to where, so there's no way he can't start and help out along the way. In fact if you try to tell him all he knows about the world then he could go out of his way to help you or just walk all over the place doing nothing. This is a classic example of a way in which the player has to be careful to steer clear of those situations, so you have the choice to wait until the start of the level or be involved until the end of it but he doesn't do that right.\n\nThis is a game that will work in virtually any situation with every type of environment. You can see it in a lot of games that you probably never play, but it makes it very difficult to know what is true and what is false. I personally think the whole point of this game is that if you do that it will be something that will help you. If you don't have time until you've just started out, I think that's a great game to have as well.\n\nI hope you enjoyed it so far and that I can start writing more of these next post.

Each party consisted of a number of warriors and was able to create up to three different weapons and abilities.\n\nThe Dark Lord's Knights believed that the strength of their army, the most powerful of all the Sith, could not be matched by that of any other Jedi Knight in the galaxy. They believed they had the capability to crush the dark side under the shadow of the Jedi King, Darth Sidious, and the Emperor's Sith, while at the same time making peace from the chaos of civil war. The Knights believed they had the means to fight the threat of the Republic, but the Republic was not a threat to all Jedi. In exchange for their lives, the Sith wanted a true Jedi Knight, one who stood for justice, freedom, and peace through the full range of their abilities and knowledge. The Jedi understood this, believing they would have the best chance of protecting the weak, the oppressed, and the oppressed in the Galactic Republic on their own. The Knights believed they could use the Light side of the Force to gain the support their fellow Jedi Knights needed and their own personal strengths\u2014especially in the struggle for truth.\n\nThe Dark Lord's Knights believed that they could kill and corrupt the Republic for no reason other than to fight. After the defeat of the Galactic Empire, and after a disastrous Clone Wars campaign, the Dark Lord's Knights set out for the Great Galactic Railroad, and the Dark Lord's Knights had many Jedi and Sith apprentices to train them in combat. One day, after returning from the Empire, the Republic military forces began to seize control of the planet of the Light Side. The Jedi Knight's name was the Sith of the Dark Side. He had been raised by the young Padawan Yoda to be the true ruler of the galaxy, but had also witnessed the Dark Lord's war with the Sith. When the Dark Lord lost the Dark Lord's sword, the dark side fled with it\u2014the Jedi Knight had become the Dark Lord's master. He could not fight the Sith in the dark side, and so was unable to do so during his time as the Republic's first Jedi Knight.\n\nWith this change of heart, the Dark Lord's Knights were transformed into a great peacekeeping force. They also sought to take the light side of the Force and free the Republic from the dark side of the Force, but were not successful. Even on the surface of a planet called Eorzea when a great war broke out, the Dark Lord's Knights would not stand idly by. The dark side of the Force threatened them, but they could not turn up the courage and tenacity of the Dark Lord's Knights to the will of the people of the galaxy. The Dark Lord's Knights would fight the Republic, but would fail to achieve peace. The dark side caused the Dark Jedi and Sith to lose their hope in the true cause for the dark side and the Republic in that they would not be victorious when they conquered the light side.\n\nIn 23 BBY, the Jedi Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi was captured by the Emperor on the Dark Side and taken to the dark side, where, under the orders of the Emperor, the Dark Lord's Knights were dispatched to rescue him and save him. The Jedi Master, however, learned that the Dark Lord's Knights were not ready to fight the Dark Lord's forces, and that those who fought on their side would be destroyed. This led Obi-Wan, along with a group of Jedi, and Yoda to the dark side; the Jedi's Master, Master Rizar Chaykorty, gave Yoda the secret to his training. When the Dark Lord's Knights arrived, they were ambushed by the Dark Lord.[9]\n\nContents show]\n\nHistory Edit\n\n\"You are the man of action.\" \u2015Ameddiah Bridger [src]\n\nIn the year 23 BBY,[18] the Dark Lord's Knights were dispatched to destroy the Dark Emperor's power and then, by chance, to seize the Emperor's palace in the Duros Republic and destroy the Republic-controlled Republic Banking Clan. The Dark Lord's Knights were later sent to the Dark Lord's palace and set fire to its halls where they destroyed everything that stood in their way. The Sith Lord and the Jedi Knight, both Jedi Knight-like entities and the Dark Emperor's Sith, had to confront their destiny when the Jedi Knights, led by the dark side's Dark Lord, Rizar, entered the palace building and took control of both Houses. At that time, the Senate had been held hostage. The Dark Lord, Darth Sidious, and Grand Moff Malak had been captured by the dark", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

I think these website types can be very helpful, but they are also pretty complex.\n\nHere are some simple rules that you'd like to keep in mind for your site.\n\nStart by being clear about what you are looking for. I am going to start by calling for a simple description of your website. These are all pretty basic things, but I'll share some basic information so that you guys can see for yourself what I think the most important and interesting things for the website are. You can also use a link, like a link to a site or even a Google Doc.\n\nIt's also OK for you to share your design or use some tools that I'll get right away in this post. For example, you could share it with a forum like /r/jamesonandtables, but then maybe share it right next to a new page, or to a website where you can get a link back to your design without having to go to the admin and have to re-enter the URL of the site to get the same link again.\n\nIf you're using WordPress, you can use a simple editor like Notepad as it's easier to use all at once. If you're using a web app like Firebase for the first few times, I strongly encourage you to use Google Spreadsheets. I think it's very easy to build with Google spreadsheets, with links and buttons and links. So if you are using the Word document manager or the Java app, I suggest you to also install those or try out them yourself.\n\nIf you're using WordPress that you plan to use in some capacity, then you can do a quick blog (no special instructions required, if done correctly) and share it just so you can go back and use it and learn from it. I hope that's helpful.\n\nIf you have any other questions or comments please feel free send them to info at [email protected].\n\nYou can also leave links to these types of websites at the bottom of this article.\n\nDon't forget about my personal and unofficial newsletter where you can get updates on new SEO stuff.\n\nWant more SEO?

{"id": 250380, "text": "In the early 1980s, a series of high school graduation rates \u2014 the top 20 percent of college graduates having dropped out by more than 10 percentage points \u2014 resulted in some pretty big change in attitudes about being a child-like person. They came from more traditional values of family; higher education, they claimed, was about having a sense of yourself; and they took the traditional values and social-emotional traits that had developed in childhood into a more advanced form that came to represent our most important self and our core values. After the 1990s, I went to see a psychologist with experience trying to explain it all on the spot as a child. That's what we've got here: \"What about children who get stuck in a world where they really get down to business and start feeling sorry for themselves? Kids who see those things and aren't interested in being friends with others? Kids who are self-conscious about their own flaws and self-centeredness? Kids who have a real sense of inadequacy and self-loathing and don't want to learn to self-better, but aren't interested in learning to be their own boss? Children that are the opposite of being an equalist when it comes to their education? And finally\u2026kids that are kind of self-aware and have strong morals. They really look at themselves as kind of a person. They don't feel so bad about themselves, when they're not working because they want to be a man who's doing his part\u2014a man who's doing his job,\" she said. \"How long, I've been thinking about those kids now and I want to put them in a world where they have a sense of self-worth.\"\n\n\"That's what we've got here: \"What about kids who get stuck in a world where they really get down to business and start feeling sorry for themselves?\"\n\nBut what if there weren't the same thing with kids all the way through? What were the chances that the children living right next to us would see the same things? The kids who lived next to me were the same children we'd seen as adults. And this is something that wasn't just a matter of some kid coming off like a bad person\u2014it was something more. It's hard to imagine a kid who's always so excited about a job that he's almost ready to open that office, and then suddenly his head spins so fast it just doesn't stop. That is a situation we've seen in many children across the country. But it's especially true today given the growing social and behavioral attitudes toward being a child. The child who gets stuck in a life of being a woman in her teen years may still feel very guilty. But, of course, what if she's feeling very fulfilled. She's the kid with her heart set on having a career and going to college and the way that she gets along has made her happy. So she might see that there's more of that in the children who are in the middle of that change. She might even realize that, if she still felt so guilty, that it's okay.\n\nThere's a lot of talk among academics, students, parents, and parents who believe that we really must all be grateful to children. I'm not even here to tell you that every parent, if they had a child with depression, should have. It's always so much easier to lose an opportunity to get out and be an actor in your child's life. And that child is not going to know how they feel when they're being asked to leave or what their parents think of them in certain situations. Some parents just don't want any children to be like them\u2014to feel like they don't have the chance to be a better person to them.\n\nThe great thing about it is, of course, that, at the end of a day, it's really as easy as it gets to be and it really isn't so much about making sure we can have kids and then losing them. A lot of times, if we had children, we'd get people on our side. But in some cases, even if we had none, there would still be the child-to-child, two-parent bond, and we'd start to think about what a difference it makes for us when we're making choices because that's how we feel. At times, it has to be that way. And in some cases, even if we didn't have one, there's still something that really separates us from the rest of the family.\n\nIf you were a person who had a son or daughter with depression from the early days of your career, who wanted to have a kid on your side, what might it be like when you did it? Because it's not always possible to have a child who says that it wasn't that we all went through a period where we struggled to deal with the pressure of what life was like in the moment.\n\n\"One of the best things about working for a company is that you get to", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

The same as we are going through our national history, if there's anything that's in Maine about male power, it's that men have always enjoyed it and that our women's power has been more than the sum of its parts.\n\nSo when women became part of the Republican Party, what happened, and why, was that women got back some men with strong majorities in the legislature and in the state legislature, and that is, as the Republicans, we were always going to have an active and powerful female legislature in our state legislature and in the state legislature.\n\nYou may recall Governor Bruce Rauner, who was a Democrat and was then a Republican, being the first female governor of a state in our history to sign the Voting Rights Act into law.\n\nSo you understand that this is what we've been talking about for years: The right of women to vote, the way the right of women have been a state and a nation in which there has always been a male power, to have had no male representation. And the other thing that I've noticed in Maine at all, even when I was running for governor in 2004, and I'm really proud of it, even if for a while I said to myself when I did have the opportunity to go through that, 'Wow, the whole place is full of men who want it that way,' and I said 'wow, I can handle this for this one, this one.' and I think the same goes for women in the legislature and in the governor's office, who know that they have a male representation in the legislature.\n\nSo the people you've talked to, the people that have been the most dedicated to the women you've spent your life following in your party, the people who are committed to women in your state, that are going to take a backseat if and when men get into the Democratic Party and you're unable to provide them a lot of support and a lot of resources, the only thing we will have is the political parties. We have no political parties.\n\nThere are, of course, men, and I've been a Republican for 15 years.

I've heard about Republicans having that power and I think they've had it. I agree with Governor Rain, but it seems that that power will always be there.\n\nI mean, it's the House of Representatives, and in this country, that's what it's been for the last 50 to 100 years. The House of Representatives was established by one man and it did not become the House of Representatives until in 1853. This is where women will have a strong voice in that House with women not just in the Senate, but in the governors.\n\nAnd by the women in the Legislature, they'll have a voice, not just in the Senate but in the governor's office, because they'll have a voice in any Senate.

His own team didn't. You could make the argument that if you don't know whether the next guy is going to play he's going to go. There just isn't the mentality of an experienced group, a group of young men, of a team that has gotten through a few difficult years, that's the mentality and you want to prove to them you still have the skills.\n\nSometimes a team is on the road and when the ball is in the air, and there's a goal where it hits you in goal and you're the one in the back, you have to make it.\n\nBut the most difficult game is a team going forward with the puck.\n\nThe puck-defender is always in front of the net and can have to be the guy who does all of the talking. It's going to turn into a situation where it'll have to be one of the better guys on the ice, if that's going to come up.\n\nWhen he's in the middle of the net, everyone will know it. And when the puck is being used, that's when everything will change.\n\nIt's not just the physical part. It's also an emotional part. That's something I feel is important.\n\nWhen there's a defensive player in the middle of the ice who can't keep his feet from getting loose, when there's a defender who's getting his head up to defend and he can't keep it straight and stop the puck, that's where you need to be, the one to support him, not the other way around. You needed to be with him as much as the puck-moving guy, that's one of the things you need to stay up there and support him.\n\nI want my guys to feel that I'm there on the other end as well. When he makes a play right there and he's not moving in any way, and he's going to get a shot off of you and it's going to be difficult to defend him, it's going to be a hard game to watch.\n\nI remember, last year, I was at a press conference after the game against the Detroit Red Wings because I didn't go up to the dressing room for that. I thought to myself, \"This is going to be tough. This is going to be a long road for us, this is going to be a long road we want to climb on.\"\n\nSo I had to start putting in my shoulder pads. I was trying to be a little more direct to my teammates, to what I wanted them to do, make sure that their actions were being heard.\n\nAfter the game, I was able to play the first two games of the season for the Florida Panthers. I'll still play this year, though. I'm more involved in this team and I'm going to be involved in this team for the rest of my career.\n\nI know that sometimes you need to be the team leader, to really believe in what you have. Sometimes you have to be more direct to others and you can't really get away from it. You just need to be the one to get the puck over there and you want to make yourself the lead.\n\nI know that I feel better because it gives you a little more comfort and a little more sense of who is really what you're trying to put in there. It takes a little bit of practice on you to really take the mental steps to get what you need to to accomplish a goal \u2014 the mental steps to get the goal you want to score on is what's so effective about the guys you play against.\n\nAnd that's just a great thing about the Florida Panthers. They're a strong football team. They're very versatile. They go out and win big games.\n\nThey have some pretty aggressive players there. That's what I love about them. I think it's going to take a little while to get the puck off them again. The good thing is their defense has gotten a little bit bigger a little bit. But the thing about the Florida Panthers is they have a lot of good, good NHL players too.\n\nAnd that's the thing about the guys that are on the ice with you at the rink. There's always some good players there and it goes hand in hand. But the thing about the guys that are the ones that actually work on those skills and show those skills to other guys.\n\nThey keep their feet on the ice well. They keep that toughness back. They keep that grit in their hockey that I think we have all of these teams going into the season playing the way we were doing last year.\n\nThey're an unbelievable hockey team.

The exhibit details their experience meeting with Joe Biden and the Boy Scouts in their community. (Amy Bresnan )\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America is a national organization to promote the mission of educating and serving the children of the U.S. Armed Forces and the communities to which they serve. The group's focus is the education of children to lead the Boy Scouts in the military, which has provided a home for over 80,000 scouts, scouts and girls over the past 60 years. More than 30 percent of the Scout troop is enrolled in high school.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nTheir goal is to serve a nation that's traditionally regarded as \"the blue\" and has a \"culture of opportunity.\" During a recent meeting, the Scouts acknowledged that they are a national organization and their mission is to \"provide a safe, supportive environment for our children to flourish as Scouts \u2014 a culture of opportunity, an opportunity to develop, to achieve and to play a critical role,\" the Scout said in a release. But the Boy Scouts have also taken note that they are also among the top 30 youth organizations in the West Coast, according to the Boy Scouts of America's annual list of leaders. \"The Boy Scouts of America has been the largest and most active Scouting community in West County, Colorado for over 2 \u00bd decades,\" said Dave LeBlanc of ScoutsUSA, an organization that is affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America headquarters at West Coast air base. LeBlanc told Metro Denver that \"it's all about the community,\" and that the organization had done a lot of work with other Boy Scouts to prepare them for the upcoming holidays.\n\n\"They're the only family group of Scouts who are members of the U.S. Military and have a lot of respect for what the military does for our people and our communities,\" he said. But the Scouts of America still have issues with \"an issue that is really important, and I think for us to have these kinds of things happen, people have to get the ball rolling,\" LeBlanc said. \"A lot of things, especially for the Scouts, there's a lot of focus on not only what we do and what Scouting does for society but also for other things.\"\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nAfter years of being criticized for not helping \"more and more American children,\" the Boy Scouts want to create new leadership teams with better leadership skills and more diversity. While the Boy Scouts of America has struggled to develop the best leadership teams to promote American values among the troops, LeBlanc said the Boy Scouts are \"aware\" of the positive aspects of their program. That includes the mission to \"teach kids that it's not just another job that we want them to take and it's a role that they should play, especially if it's not a full-time, part-time, full-time job.\" He said the Scouts also want a mission, even for kids in a limited role. He said many members of those communities have no understanding of the value of a full-time job, and that while the Boy Scouts are well-represented, it's an issue that the community should be focusing on. For those in positions like the Air Force, Marine Corps or Coast Guard, he said, a good way to address the issue is to focus on young people who were enlisted or have already decided to leave the military in the past year, if not two to three years later. He acknowledged that the Scouts are looking at the long-term and making a change, but would only change \"when there's good reasons to do those changes.\" On the issue of recruiting, the Boys Scouts of America said it's important to \"focus on what's important to the community and what's important to the Scouts,\" he said. The Boy Scouts of America said their goal is to bring the Scouts into more of a serviceable role. The Boy Scouts of America is an all-volunteer organization, including its members. LeBlanc emphasized that the Scouts of America is an \"excellent example\" of the youth organization working to bring these kinds of organizations in. LeBlanc said most Boy Scouts can talk about what it means to be a Scout, but he hopes they can have a meaningful impact when members of their community want to talk for themselves about their roles in society.

That's because you can use any one of the various \"no-button\" buttons as described by \"In\" on the above page. The \"On\" button lets you turn the camera or camera sensor on or off with the \"On\" button. The \"Off\" button turns the camera or camera sensor off. There are several different \"On/Off\" buttons. (The \"Off\" button is shown below and will be in the top-right corner of your screen and also in your \"On\" button.) So you turn the camera or camera sensor off when your camera or camera sensor has been turned on. The number \"On\" can be one of many numbers.\n\nHow To: Choose your camera or camera sensor from the list below\n\n\nYou can switch between some of the \"On\" and \"Off\" toggle switches on the main camera. If you can't go anywhere else, it will show as \"On\" instead, with a button on the \"On\" button.\n\n\nThe left side of the sensor is called LOS for \"No Camera Camera\" and is connected to a USB \"on\" button. The right side is called NO if it doesn't have ANY camera on and NO if it doesn't have any camera.\n\n\nThe camera or camera sensor will be turned ON when the phone is connected. The button is shown as \"On\" after it receives contact data. There was no data lost when you turned the camera ON. The phone was powered up and can no longer be turned OFF. You can no longer turn ON the camera or camera sensor.\n\nHow To: Choose your camera or camera sensor from the list below\n\n\nThe screen will tell your \"Camera\" or \"Controller\" of the number.

I was really happy to go to sleep at night or when my friends were together (which is why they would not stop seeing me as soon as I woke up).\n\n\nHow To: Choose your camera or camera sensor from the list below\n\n\nYou may use multiple different LOS settings to set up the battery to turn OFF while the system is connected and on.\n\n\nI chose to use on. But to change all my settings when the camera or camera sensor is turned ON, you must have the LOS (LX) setting (a small rectangle on the left of the screen) and set the \"On\" button to ON, with the camera (I was at one point having a camera turn OFF while using the \"Off\" button), and the \"Off\" button to ON.\n\n\nThe following picture shows my camera setting up using LOS from left to right:\n\nYou can then change the number of times that the camera or camera sensor turns on. Remember, the LOS number can be anything you like. I was surprised that I started using those buttons at night and could not remember how to adjust them so this was not an option for me. I would rather just let my phone show and not bother with any button on my system. So here is the problem I encountered when using LOS with different camera or camera sensor settings for different tasks: I would have to switch back and forth between using all the cameras I had on and not even remembering how to do both my \"On\" and \"Off\" buttons at once. I would need to figure out how to get to my computer, which would have to be a computer with an external power outlet. I am sure this will only work on the latest software versions of my camera or camera sensors.\n\nHow To: Choose your camera or camera sensor from the list below\n\n\nI chose to use LOS for two days, but after going on a new mission with my little friend, the battery life had gone down to about 1 day when \"On\" was turned off and \"Off\".

{"id": 250394, "text": "In a report released on July 25th, Gizmodo reported that some of the \"most disturbing\" findings in the report were presented to the U.S. Department of Defense's (DOD) Office of National Drug Abuse Prevention. The Pentagon's Department of Veterans Affairs is responsible for developing and administering drugs like buprenorphine and fenfluramine to veterans, and it has an Office of Substance Abuse and Consumer Services (NASAD) role in conducting a comprehensive inventory for VA health centers. The report, \"What is the Health of Veterans Who Use Alcohol in Veterans Health Care?\" is an investigative report that examines what a good proportion of drug use may lead to drug addiction, mental health problems and other serious health issues. Gizmodo reports that veterans with drug use problems suffer from significant issues and health problems in VA Health centers, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has conducted drug testing and other research to determine the causes. The report also discusses an ongoing investigation into patients who were reported to have drug use problems in the VA Health Department of Iraq and Afghanistan (VHAD), which was headed by the then-Cynthia J. McGovern. After her health problems became public, Dr. McGovern resigned as VA secretary in December 2002 after taking a year off after her post for substance abuse.\n\nThe report reveals an \"out-of-court maneuver\" of both McGovern and DOD to \"initiate research and development of an anti-psychotic anti-epileptic therapy, without publicly disclosing the specific clinical trials reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association [USAMS].\" This maneuver involved creating a non-profit registry to protect veterans' health, and it is unclear if this kind of \"initiative\" would have had a similar impact as what has taken place with VA-funded drugs like VX. The study of \"What is the Health of Veterans Who Use Substance Abuse\"? is written by John O'Sullivan and Dr. Stephen Maitland who are veteran psychiatrists with expertise in substance use disorders that were contracted by the Veterans Administration to study and identify veterans who needed medical treatment. The researchers also interviewed some of the veterans who have been served with the VA and found that \"the majority of veterans who use cannabis continue to use it.\" While some of the most frequently reported drug use problems are in their primary medical diagnosis in which the brain is overloaded with THC as a result of a \"cannabis dependency,\" most other use problems occur \"when the caregiver or caregiver's behavior is controlled to some degree by the medication.\"\n\nIt was found that people who used marijuana for an amount of time before becoming addicted to alcohol have higher rates of drug use problems than those who didn't use drugs in the long term. They also also have more trouble concentrating and memory loss in the early days after substance abuse (though also more frequent mental health issues), because \"when marijuana was used for long periods of time and the ability to move around changed, it is likely that some of the other factors also took hold and led to this problem.\"\n\nDrug abuse is a human health condition that can affect multiple groups of people in various ways: people living with an addiction or someone living with addiction to drugs and a host of other factors. Some people suffer from significant psychological problems, such as anxiety or depression. Others use drugs as they choose to, often for personal reasons. People who suffer from substance abuse problems are a minority of the community. The VA has the highest rate of drug use in the U.S., with about 1.0 million per year. They are also on a very low priority list for prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation in the face of increasing drug use, which is putting these veterans at a tremendous risk and putting their lives on the line to help fight drug abuse.\n\nWhat is the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) role in providing medical services to veterans?\n\nWhat is the medical care that VA employees receive each year to fight drug abuse? According to the VA study, \"Most VA offices have at least one VA specialist trained on a major drug side effect treatment (MTE)/mental health treatment (MHRM) in a state of active awareness and experience. For example, the National Institute of Mental Health supports MTI/ME. The Medical Department has a number of services for chronic substance abuse and related conditions like substance abuse and dependence. On the other hand, there is a lot of administrative involvement, management, and support in the area of addiction and related conditions. VA staff are paid for a good amount of treatment for MTE and ME and are also eligible to receive Medicaid. MTE and ME are usually treated in clinics. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, through Healthcare.gov, operates both MTE and ME services for the specific needs of these populations and provides funding for them through both the VA Health Services Providers Fund and Medicare.\" The Department spends 2,700 days every fiscal year on the study of MTE/ME", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

It's still not clear, but some theorists say there is more than one explanation \u2014 some are more \"invisible\"\u2014 than others. The theory posits that the cosmos is expanding at more or less the same speed as what we are now known as electromagnetic fields.\n\nThe latest study, published in PLOS ONE today (July 11), reports that the theory of accelerating cosmic expansion holds both for both matter and energy. It comes more than a decade after new observations in a small space observatory at the centre of a solar system.\n\n\"The new results are compelling results, not just for the speed of expansion and what we call the cosmic microwave background radiation, but also for our basic understanding of how the cosmic microwave background is transmitted and received,\" said lead author Michael Kelleher, a space physicist at California Institute of Technology.\n\nThe fact that the experiment measured the speed of light is so startling that one wonders whether there was anything the microwave background radiation would have allowed.\n\n\"We don't know that there was an acceleration or other source beyond the universe; it is possible that there may have been some effect beyond the cosmic microwave background,\" Kelleher told The Astrophysical Journal and lead author Stephen Lipski, another space physicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"There are many potential explanations for the slowdown of our universe.\"\n\nIt's an extremely bright spot right now, and many people in the scientific community believe that this is what physicists call \"black hole spacetime.\"\n\nIn this region, the black holes of the universe seem to be spinning \u2014 moving around and merging.\n\n\"We see lots of massive objects \u2014 black holes, pulsars \u2014 spinning around in supermassive black holes,\" said Lipski. \"We see that the black hole activity is going to occur much faster than the expansion of the universe. It is actually happening much faster than this expansion.\"\n\nThe new findings suggest that there may have been a mechanism beyond the universe to produce the speeding up of our own universe. Perhaps the speed of the expanding universe was accelerating on the other hand in its earliest phase.

In 2050, China will have the fastest growing population by far, with 2.8 billion people, the report suggests. While in the past it has been projected that China will grow by nearly 2.1 billion within the next two decades, the figure has risen since last year. The average China resident is expected to live in the United States at 18.7 years old, up from 17.9 in 2009, the report said.\n\n\nOn a global scale, the report's projections make sense when compared with the global average, which shows a rise in the world's population more or less in tandem with a increase in the consumption of water and food, the report suggested. The world will likely grow by about 3.0 billion by 2050, which is larger than the U.S. growth rate for this purpose. This growing population, the report said, \"will be the driving force behind a global climate change that will lead to an unprecedented rise in the world's greenhouse gas emissions.\"\n\nRelated: The world's most densely populated planet\n\nThe report noted that despite a rise in the global average in the last four decades, global emissions remain close to 1990 levels by 2005 despite the \"long-term acceleration of climate change.\" Globally, the report said, \"climate change threatens to create more instability in the global system if countries and industries fail to cope with large-scale climate change.\"\n\n\nThis \"continuing growth in growth in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050\" should, in turn, drive further increases in agriculture, fishing and mining\u2014large sectors of China's economy\u2014and will, the report said, lead to \"increasing inequalities and an underbelly with which social classes and communities depend on the growth of natural resources in the world.\" These increases will bring global food security, the report said, especially \"the most sensitive regions of the world, such as the developing world, and particularly China\" and \"the richest members of the world's rich urban families.\"\n\n\nThe report also said China's share of GDP will fall after 2050, the longest decline of any emerging, developing or developing country. The report said that by 2050, global GDP in China will have been in the top 1 percent of all developed countries, but \"the average increase in real world GDP will be in the bottom 10 percent of developed and developing countries.\"\n\n\nRelated: Top 20 countries in the world with the highest income inequality \u00bb\n\n\n\"In contrast to the global average, growth in GDP will increase in China in the next decade as well as in the developed world, and this momentum should translate into significant income gains for all of the developing world. The increase in inequality in China will also provide significant opportunities for investment in clean, renewable energy, and other energy technologies that are already growing in China because of the large and stable infrastructure it produces,\" the report said.\n\nThe United States and other Asian Pacific countries, including Japan and South Korea, are the world's largest source of greenhouse gases \u2014 more than twice as much as the U.S. combined, the report said.\n\n\nChina's greenhouse gas emissions are increasing by 50 percent per year for the first time since 1960, and they have grown rapidly since 2007.\n\n\nRelated: China will be under the economic burden of US energy woes\n\n\"China's greenhouse gas emissions have significantly declined compared to the U.S., which has seen large declines. While China remains the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, it currently accounts for just 0.7 percent of global emissions, which is the lowest per capita level of greenhouse gas pollution in the developed world,\" the report said.\n\n\nTo increase energy independence, Chinese coal will play a key role in reducing emissions from coal plants and other fossil fuels, according to China's Energy Ministry. Beijing will also provide major subsidies for projects that improve China's environmental quality, the report said.", "length": 812, "ended": true}

We are aware of the tragic events surrounding these last few days, but are working closely with the UK's Intelligence and Security Services of MI6 on its approach to investigating any potential involvement of the terrorist by the British\".\n\nTwo weeks after the incident, the MoD called on the US to provide \"security assistance\".\n\nU.S. intelligence officials say that in December 2015 al-Baghdadi's \"personal bodyguard\" was dispatched to the compound, where members of al-Qaida and Jabhat al-Nusra were believed to be fighting, where he was reportedly killed. \"We know this was a U.S.-supplied ambush which killed al-Baghdadi. And it is still unclear who would have been behind this ambush,\" said one source close to the investigation.\n\nOn July 22, 2014 four US-funded security groups, led by the FBI, released a report that alleged al-Baghdadi had been a \"militant\", who \"talks, acts or fights\" from a \"near remote location, which it could not physically confirm and has not been identified by the U.S. government as a safe haven for future terrorist activities.\"\n\nA month later, the Pentagon confirmed al-Baghdadi was also a \"militant\", who was killed as a result of \"unidentified\" airstrikes on a \"substantially different location\".\n\nUS officials have long acknowledged that al-Baghdadi travelled to Iraq from Pakistan, and was once known for his support of al-Qaeda. They also point out that al-Baghdadi had met with US officials at least a year before his death, and that the US had informed his family and other supporters in the region of plans to kill him.\n\nBut they also allege that U.S. intelligence assessments suggest that al-Baghdadi actually was involved with al-Qaida itself.\n\nIn a December 2014 e-mail exchange, a CIA operative told an analyst about a meeting between the British Foreign Secretary, William Hague, and Pakistani officials in Dubai that may have shown U.S. intelligence to al-Baghdadi's superiors.\n\nThe e-mail contained a series of highly explicit references to al-Qaida and its leadership.\n\nA senior U.S. official told the e-mailer that it was \"likely that some significant al-Qaida leaders and operatives who appeared to be present at al-Baghdadi's assassination would continue to communicate with him or their al-Qaida affiliates until he was assassinated.\" Two weeks later, an intelligence briefing issued by the Joint Staff in June 2016, which outlined some of the high-level issues around al-Baghdadi's death, also stated that al-Qaida may be involved.\n\nThe e-mail also noted that \"the group has repeatedly been described in the U.S. public sphere as 'the most important organization of interest'.\n\n\"However, this reference to al-Qaida clearly refers to the presence of al-Qaida 'supervises in the international sphere' as the main threat posed to the United States and its allies (such as Pakistan), not al-Baghdadi personally,\" the official said. \"This statement of concern was based on previous intelligence that clearly indicates a willingness to participate in terrorist attacks under the guise of protecting U.S. interests.\n\n\"It was not known how Al Qaeda would receive that intelligence. This information has never been verified by any U.S. government and was thus clearly inconsistent with the U.S. national security objectives.\n\n\"Moreover, it appears that both al-Qaida and other Islamist groups may wish to continue to communicate with al-Qaida directly, including through a direct relationship with al-Qaida affiliates in Pakistan.\"\n\nIn a separate e-mail, the director of the Middle East and North Africa Operations (MIAMI), Gen. David Goldsmith, confirmed that at least three CIA analysts had identified al-Baghdadi during a June 2016 assessment of AQAP. The analysts were \"reviewing the intelligence and their understanding of what they could tell the public about future targets and their activities, and what actions they would take under the current and future circumstances.\" The assessment also provided a timeline for al-Baghdadi's upcoming attacks.\n\nThe analysts were \"reviewing the intelligence\" and \"making the right investment decisions\" for their future, MIAMI told the CIA on June 10. The assessment noted the \"current risk profile\" and noted that AQAP leader Osama bin Laden was about to become the next figure in power.\n\nAccording to the analysts, the al-Qaida affiliate was looking for \"major, major targets, to use, or to avoid, by using or using", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

Her first marriage was made in 1847 with Queen Victoria.\n\nIn that marriage Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth II were the first cousins of Mary Magdalene and Mary the Virgin. However, their romance was also a tumultuous affair.\n\nOn the one hand, the Queen was an active Catholic and her love affair with Catholicism was not the only issue between the two young brothers who eventually turned out to be brothers and sisters. Her Catholic faith was one of the many factors that led to Queen Victoria's divorce. Her mother then was an advocate of marriage to any non-Christian faiths and that led to her eventual divorce.\n\nA History of Princess Margaret's Marriage with the Motherland Queen Victoria married the great Catholic saint Elizabeth at the height of her Catholic faith to form the Virgin Mary. Her second marriage to the monarch was also a significant event in Canada. The Queen's first two children, Princess Margaret's First Wife, Queen Elizabeth in 1850 and Princess Margaret in 1859 were born at New York's New York City Baptist Hospital. The latter has continued to be associated with the Catholic faith under the name of Mary Magdalene. They were considered to be Catholic after all. The second Princess Victoria, Princess Margaret's Second, married Prince Charles IV of the United Kingdom in 1856. The first of two children, Princess Diana, was born only two weeks after the Queen. Despite her Catholicism in her marriage, the second Princess Margaret lived in New York and was considered to be Catholic after her father passed away during her second marriage. In addition, the first Princess Margaret later served as Princess of Wales. Princess Margaret's second marriage to Prince Charles IV was a major turning point for Canadian Catholic leadership.\n\nPrincess Margaret, Queen Elizabeth II, and King Edward VII became involved in the Catholic Church during the 16th century. Both became religious leaders at times in America and eventually in Ireland. In England's 16th century, Queen Alexandra and Queen Jane were both Catholic mothers. Their first relationship occurred at the age of six or seven when Queen Victoria was married to her grandfather Charles II but his marriage to Princess Alexandra was annulled as well (1803 when the King of Scotland had her second child).\n\nThe Queen was also part of a Catholic family which is a significant example of Protestant history as the Catholic faith was part of its founding tradition. In 1749, Queen Victoria had an engagement to a Catholic man named Edward I.\n\nKing Edward VII gave the Queen and her first children Queen Margaret, Prince Albert, Princess Diana, Princess Sarah, Princess Mary, Princess Anne, and Princess Maria when she was three years old (1757). King Edward VII ordered the Queen to become a Catholic missionary in France and was instrumental in the establishment of a system of Catholic baptism in that country.\n\nThe second Princess Margaret, Princess Anne, had several successful encounters with Catholic organizations. The Queen was also involved in the establishment of a Catholic ministry in 1837 during the Revolution in Haiti.\n\nQueen Elizabeth is not considered to be the first born Catholic. The first Archbishop of Canterbury of New Britain was a Catholic at the age of twelve, Archbishop John Theodosius of York was born in England in 1803 and is the only Canadian in the Anglican Church. Queen Elizabeth was one of only three living Catholics in her lifetime, while only two of the other members of the current Queen's own Protestant family. Her last marriage was to the Duke of Bedford in 1825 only and also to her sister Anna in 1827. Princess Margaret was married to Cardinal John Pemberton of Boston in 1835 who also had an important role in the establishment of the Anglican Church in England. The Queen's second marriage lasted from 1835 to 1842 as Princess Alexandra stayed with her uncle and then became her second wife.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II became very involved with the Catholic Church a number of times during her history as Queen. In 1857, she wrote her letter to her husband Edward, Archbishop of Canterbury, in which he urged her to become her religious leader. He also encouraged her to take part in the founding of Catholic charities and institutions. Queen Elizabeth was also involved in the establishment of the Universal Church of England and a Catholic orphanage at King's Cross, Manchester until 1866. In 1873, she and her brother William of Orange founded the first Catholic church in the UK as the Catholic Church of Britain. The first Catholic church in New York was founded by Princess Margaret, the eldest daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, the first Catholic woman, in London in 1787.\n\nThe Pope's Council on Religions and the Church of England in the 18th Century was led by two of the most famous Catholic bishops, Cardinal Bernard Proulx and Cardinal James, from an Anglican-American council.

But the question becomes: where is Bill?' 'When did he become a political insider?' 'When, for instance, did he go to the FBI and say he was investigating the murder of a British prime minister when there were concerns that someone might assassinate him?' 'And when? When did he ask you: 'Do you know who did this?' 'When did he tell you of what we might find during a trip to Paris to see Mr Sion?' 'When did he become known to you?' 'And when was it?' 'So that's all that matters.' 'How much did you know who was involved in Tony Blair's murder and what his thinking was on the murder of the American ambassador to Britain?' 'What do you think about it, as you and I have tried to explain it,' he said. 'In his book he makes very clear that he's had a very important involvement in the investigation.' Webb was one of the original activists for anti-apartheid movement group The Green Berets, who eventually won a Supreme Court challenge to apartheid's regime, before being forced out by the military on May 30 following a protest in the city. On the Sunday before he was arrested, he said that he had been to the West Point hospital with five other former soldiers and two U.S. soldiers. 'I have three bullets to my head and 10 to my leg from each of those bullets in total,' he said. 'Five bullets in total. What? Five bullets in total. And what about the bullet that goes to my leg and it goes down the street to the side?' 'I have six bullets in total.' 'Did you go to the hospital with anyone and you didn't see any of them?' 'Yes. Do you remember the bullets that were hit?' 'No'. 'So, if you go back to your memory that the bullets hit you and you try to recover from that, you are on the other side?' Webb was questioned repeatedly by people of the group, including former Army Major William O'Shea, chief forensic officer of the Special Investigations Unit of B.C.'s Criminal Investigation Branch (CIB), after he said he'd heard of one alleged serial killer. That killer, however, was never identified because of a confidentiality agreement with O'Shea. Webb said he'd been following the case ever since and could not have been persuaded to go into full detail in his book. There were no other people who had contacted his office about his involvement with Travi$ha. 'I wanted to know the details of what Travi$ha's doing. It's not like a detective is going to tell you the whole picture. He just needs to ask questions. He needs to ask what the facts are.' O'Shea was among the first to express concern in early August, when news of Webb's alleged involvement was first published. He was quoted as saying it 'looks like they want to send a message that it's OK to let that happen to you'. The allegations have been confirmed by the U.S. Army's Special Forces Intelligence. O'Shea would not talk about his relationship with Webb for this article. The Army has said Travi$ha did have his own private Twitter account in April 2016. At that time, it had about 11 percent followers on Travi$ha's other Facebook page, despite being only a fraction of its full potential. He was not contacted for this article.\n\nA number of members of the Travi$ha group had made statements before, during and since his arrest, during the summer and fall of 2010 that indicated he had been influenced by political and military figures. Among the most prominent of those statements was a statement of his former comrades at the Travi$ha camp, where he told of the military and \"others who may find themselves victims of violence, corruption and brutality\". 'I never thought that I would be able to find out something that will make them think that I would be doing something for the British public of which every woman, African-American male should have seen,' he said. O'Shea had also stated that he had been involved in 'one of the many instances as a part of the British Defence Forces that I was in touch with [Haiti's] father' after he was captured by the Sri Lankan Armed Force (SPF]. Webb, who had been in contact with Sri Lankan Defence Forces (SLAF), said he had been the primary conduit for sending the messages. In a short email sent only some day after he was taken into custody, O'Shea described his role as 'an interpreter for the Sri Lankan Armed Forces and I would be very willing to help with any further contact with the SLAF.'

It's simply not possible for a manufacturer in a brand or product to say: \"Hey there, let's put down your new car, get out and do it again.\"\n\nFord's problem\n\nThe first time I heard the term recall came in the summer of '90, when a few friends of mine had been buying used Ford vehicles on eBay, and they felt certain that I would need to use a loan to buy a used Toyota Prius or a used Honda Accord. The seller at the time offered to buy an off-the-shelf Ford vehicle of their own, which wasn't yet a registered dealer. Then they were offered a few options on the deal-the option to purchase a car back from them outright, or a $20 loan to get their used Ford vehicles out of the house.\n\nThat's all that happened in 1994 and 2001, when, through the help of the National Motorists Association's Fair Deal for Sale, the Fair Deal for Sale went into effect. The car that the dealer offered to buy was sold in two different \"districts,\" each with various dealer locations. The Ford car had four owners, most of whom were dealers, and had one on the same bank. The seller had to get the buyer's name on the cover of the car, and the name on the covers of the other cars to ensure they were registered. (The Ford car owner had to provide a photo ID and be approved.)\n\nThe dealership had a few things in common, one of which was the seller's name, and a few of which was the dealer's address. So even though the dealer was in business at the time, there were no local rules about who could and could not use any other dealer's vehicle. So the dealer had to know who they were buying from anyway.\n\nIn 1999, Ford decided to issue its first nationwide recall of GM's Chevrolet Bolt with its own recall. There were no new models coming out in the U.S. and GM had no problems with the recall, according to Bob Jones, who then helped put together a report by National Motorists Association and Consumer Watchdog.\n\nBut as part of this new effort, a major industry lobbying group called \"StopTheDealers.org\" issued a statement in 2004 stating that the Ford recall was an \"unconscionable and unproven problem.\" (If the statement made in 2006 in Texas is accurate, it's not much more.) The problem started with GM, a manufacturer of gas-powered vehicles, and its two other main dealers, as well as with its U-verse division. By 2004, the two companies agreed that they wanted to make their own new cars in a non-traditional and nontraditional (and environmentally friendly) fashion, and the \"StopTheDealers for GM\" campaign (the term has been used in the media in the United States) began. The group has now hired the Consumer Defense Fund to press \"refund\" on the car's current owners, in return for $18,000 payment for an estimated 20 years back in terms of \"repair, new paint, new tires, oil pump, new windows, paint, new front passenger seat, new windshield.\" GM's new model will be available only to local buyers (and dealers for lease), and will not be able to be resold to a dealership with a dealer-assigned owner to replace it.\n\nThat's where a bit of a \"StopTheDealers\" campaign becomes very useful. It turns out that if you have a dealer's name or address on the cover you can purchase it on any dealer, on any dealer store, and on any dealer website without paying a dealer or customer service representative. In a way this is pretty much the same as using credit cards to buy a used car online. That's what they're doing.", "length": 877, "ended": true}

The lawsuits included allegations the games would be biased and potentially hurt regional ties with local leagues, while Spanish national team and local soccer teams were being treated unfairly by the authorities.\n\nIn late March, FIFA's regional committee for the 2018 World Cup, known as the U.N., asked a judge in Madrid to remove the tournament from the World Cup schedule. But this month, its executive committee voted to stop the tournament indefinitely after the appeals court sided with the majority, upholding FIFA's decision.\n\nThis has put much of the pressure on Spain-based soccer clubs, who have no financial incentive to compete during the tournament. Spain holds the quarter-finals of the CONCACAF Champions League, but is looking at a number of other qualifying events instead of the tournament and would likely be left out if Fifa has not responded by March 15.\n\nFIFA is suing three Spanish football clubs for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and false and incomplete invoices, alleging negligence in performance. The Spanish league, Estadio Olimpico de Madrid, is also seeking arbitration.\n\nOn Thursday evening, FIFA's General Secretary, Maria Bartiromo, described the legal action as \"a complete breach\" of Spanish soccer's duty to provide for a fair game in the tournament, saying, \"It will not help us achieve our goal of a sporting event without taking the sport seriously enough to address the systemic problems it produces within the sporting community.\"\n\nThe action against two Spanish soccer clubs comes days before the two-week World Cup in Brazil kicks off on January 1, as FIFA is expected to host host the 2022 FIFA Confederations Cup, which will take place from May to July.

{"id": 250409, "text": "A little after noon on Sept. 14, the same day that the House agreed to a bipartisan health care bill, Republicans on the Finance Committee passed a bill to expand coverage to everyone in the U.S. by April 1, 2017. The idea was that by eliminating the tax credits that make up most of insurance plans sold through the exchanges, insurers would also see a boost to their premiums by eliminating individual mandate payments. The provision would also add $500 billion per year into the federal Medicaid program, according to Congressional Budget Office.\n\nAs a result, some insurance carriers have started to buy some ACA coverage that is currently covered by existing plans on the exchanges even though many who have purchased coverage there already don't have the option to qualify for it. In fact, those carriers who have had their plans canceled by October of this year have been getting little help from the government in finding insurance to replace the canceled plans in exchange for less expensive coverage.\n\nIf the House passes a bill to roll out the tax credits, as is the case in most states, the president cannot end the current financial crisis. The same is true for Medicaid programs like Medicare, which has been growing slowly. The U.S. Medicaid program will go forward next year even though it cost $200 billion last year, according to a report by the nonpartisan Urban Institute, and as we reported yesterday, in fact the total number of beneficiaries with Medicaid insurance has decreased as a result of the financial crisis.\n\nIf Congress passes such a measure, the Affordable Care Act will be fully repealed. That means that the Obama administration will continue to charge premiums and deductibles for the vast majority of American adults and young people who will continue to be sick and dependent upon the government for coverage.\n\nWith Congress still sitting on a very low-wage, middle-class government program (and it's hard not to see why) and with the cost of the current insurance program soaring, the president remains bound to continue forcing insurance companies to sell plans that are so expensive that their customers can't afford it. And that's why those carriers are now going through an intense regulatory process for selling premiums and premium discounts across the state and nationally.\n\nIn order to preserve federal tax credits, the Obama administration has created the \"Affordable Care Act\" (\"ACA\") which would make ObamaCare a tax-deductible insurance market. The ACA is not only about how much the federal government can charge individuals but it's also about how much the federal government can collect, thus creating a tax subsidy from companies based at the federal level. The subsidy would be distributed to states and the federal government to assist with the expansion of Medicaid and reduce Medicaid spending, thus saving the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars each year. Under a bill to repeal Obamacare, some insurance carriers would get the tax credits, while others would get more federal funds.\n\nOne insurance carrier that is getting a subsidy on top of a state-by-state discount is Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arkansas, which received a subsidy from both the state and the federal government for providing health insurance for its 800,000 residents. The company was founded in 2013 on a farm in Texas where one third of workers and over 10 percent of households are covered by the ACA.\n\nThis would put any number of insurance companies in this competition. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arkansas paid out $17 million in subsidy payments to the state, as per ACA program rules and can claim federal benefits.\n\nIn addition, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas will also have a subsidy on top of being paid by insurers to provide health insurance to its 400,000 residents.\n\nThis would mean that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arkansas, one of the least affordable insurers in the country, could find itself in a hole if ObamaCare gets passed, as the state already has a federal subsidy for providing health insurance and pays no federal penalty at all for uninsured individuals. The current subsidy of $4,000 a year, or nearly double the current subsidy paid for the ACA, does not cover people like Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arkansas.\n\nThis is particularly relevant because Obamacare also requires states, like Arkansas, to provide up to 18 weeks of coverage for those newly insured through their Medicaid program. That requirement would be much higher in states like Arizona and the District of Columbia (where the ACA is the law), which have a lot lower rates. For some states, the mandate can be found at an individual's local, state, and federal levels.\n\nIf a state does decide to extend Medicaid, it would get federal funding to help pay for those new Medicaid enrollees. But only about $2 million is going to pay for the rest of the premiums the health insurance companies cover. The state could find herself facing some significant federal debt since the government would have to cover it if the new enrollees are eligible for insurance on their own. In addition, many high-income people will likely be struggling with these premium rates. It could mean that the cost savings of expanding Medicaid could be much higher.\n\nEven though", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

Apparently his water bottles need to be full of water after a certain point and it took three drinks to add all the water.\n\nI'm not sure if I need to do a little shopping for my bottle of water because there are so many people who are just looking for water so it's not important for me to pick something I like.

This was when I found out that my boyfriend had left and he was asking me to go on a cruise. What will I do with everything now?! The next thing I know, he's drinking my water!!! This time I had to leave the room. I'm sitting on my hands and knees and there was so much water coming out of my glass! I didn't even know it was happening.\n\nMy boyfriend started asking me if I had a favorite beverage as he said he doesn't need water. I said YES! I was so pissed it was happening and we could have just sat still and played ping pong. My boyfriend then told us he could have our glasses of milk for him so that we could get some of it! Now I can just order my bottle of water and he could just leave it somewhere as long as it's clean.\n\nI'm very sad to report this. Our friends got my order at 3.45 pm. I took my friends back to my room. We went over to the bathroom and sat at a corner waiting to see what had happened. I tried not to worry about it and just gave them the bottle back. The first hour had been great but now the water has started to become hot and I am very concerned.\n\nThe bartender was quick enough to get my group to let me know that I was welcome to order drinks as long as there were no people drinking at all!

{"id": 250418, "text": "A group of scientists, led by Professor Peter Braben, have discovered a new method to capture the effects of UV light that may help to combat cancers.\n\nThe scientists, who work at McMaster University, have long been fascinated with the dark side of sunlight, with its ability to affect the natural chemical processes within the red and orange molecules (RBCs) in the eye and to alter the chemical structures of the cell surface.\n\nAs far back as 2011 an international team of scientists published their work on the photochemist's vision using an approach that could help to treat glaucoma, or macular degeneration, in the eye of a patient called R. macularis.\n\nThe group now proposes that a similar technique could also be used to treat the same problem.\n\nThe new method of light can be used for three reasons: sunlight can be extremely bright, so it can be used either as a laser, or as a light source, or both.\n\nThe researchers first used light produced from a particular wavelengths of UV light on four individual cells (blue in our case, yellow in the red light). The cells were taken from three individuals with glaucoma, one male and two female. The researchers looked at their blood levels of the blue light, the red light, and the orange light.\n\nThe results were so surprising that it prompted them to investigate how light is reflected in the light reflected by the light from the cells, and at the end of the study they were able to reveal some fundamental information about how UV light is reflected and reflected by the cells.\n\nThe results, which was published in the Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology and is the second published paper of interest on how light is reflected and reflected by the blue and red wavelength wavelength classes. The first one, published in The Guardian, showed that the cells produced the red-orange radiation that is reflected by wavelengths from 0 to 7, as well as from 4.0 to 2.0 times the wavelength.\n\nThe second new paper, published in Nature Photonics, shows that the RBCs produced at higher wavelengths are also affected by both light and radiation, and that this effect doesn't only involve photons passing through the RBCs. This could lead to some changes in how light acts in and out of cells and the process that controls it.\n\nThe discovery, they state, is \"an important step towards understanding light's ability to act as a chemical energy source and not just a light-emitting diodes or a reflection mechanism.\"\n\nThe results show that by being able to capture and release a specific type of radiation, which might also reflect the blue and red wavelengths seen with RBCs, these cells could be used for treatments of both macular degeneration, as well as those with macular degeneration.\n\nFor the researchers, this makes the research a major step forward in their vision research.\n\nProfessor Steven D.

{"id": 250419, "text": "A new batch of data shows how food allergies might contribute to autism, with researchers showing that children with one of these symptoms can cause some symptoms of autism before they've experienced others.\n\nChildren with two or more of the major symptoms of autism \u2014 intolerance of gluten, intolerance of dairy, sensitivity to high-fat foods and allergies to allergens \u2014 will appear less likely to develop autism before age four, when they mature.\n\nAnd in some cases, symptoms that show up at four months of age won't start at all \u2014 they'll \"grow on,\" according to the results of a multi-billion-dollar study published this week in the journal Autism.\n\nThose with any of the symptoms of autistic spectrum and developmental delay, such as intolerance to fats, intolerance of dairy and some allergies to allergens that are more severe than autism, are about seven times more likely than children without the specific symptoms of autism to develop at least moderate-to-severe autism while in school, which is considered by many people the most severe type of disease.\n\nThe new study by researchers at the University of Michigan and the Mayo Clinic and published today in Nature Communications reveals that as people age and have children who seem to develop autism at young ages, the incidence of those symptoms decreases over their life span. And if the symptoms of Autism become more severe over time, that's when children with them are most likely at risk for having a similar spectrum disorder, according to the findings of a new study presented here earlier this week.\n\n\"It appears that a large number of children who are exposed to gluten, soy, refined fats and dairy are at increased risk for developing autism as early as fifth or sixth years of age,\" said lead author Dr. David J. Johnson, who heads the Institute of Epidemiology and Psychiatric Research of the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\n\"Given the potential for a spectrum issue at any age, it is critical that we understand whether there are genetic or environmental factors that contribute to autism, and therefore what's going to happen with these children,\" said Johnson, the report's senior author.\n\nThe findings, which are published in the November issue of Science Advances, found the risk of developing autism in children with two conditions could be 50 percent lower when a child is at risk for autism compared to kids with the other conditions, such as wheat, that are not genetically related, such as autism in infancy. At a 10 percent risk, the risk for severe autistic disorder is 5 percent less. All four conditions occur more frequently at older ages.\n\nFor those with one, the risk of severe autism drops gradually between kindergarten and age five, and about a quarter of them are at the most severe \u2014 with many more children with the two conditions diagnosed as common in that age group by the first trimester of life as the age at which children with autism are at the most severe. But for children with the other two conditions, at least two out of three of the worst outcomes are at four to eight years of age. And that's even if, for some children, the most severe symptoms of autism are less often seen from childhood.\n\nAbout 20 to 30 percent of children with the two conditions of autism develop autism before their first trimester, and only 3 percent later.\n\nFor those with children without the severe symptoms of autism, that's about 14 percent of the time. But at about 25 percent, some 20 percent of children suffer the most severe symptoms. Those children typically develop at their peak, from 4 to 12 years of age, while the most severe symptoms are in fifth through eighth years.\n\nWhat's more, while the proportion of children diagnosed with severe autism in the United States with two or more of the major symptoms of autism is nearly identical to that of other developed and affected children \u2014 about 14 percent \u2014 the prevalence in the United States of one or more of the major symptoms of autistic disorder is substantially higher for those children with the severe symptoms than for any other type of child at the highest risk of developing autism.\n\nIn a press release, Johnson said this is the first study to report on the risk of developing autistic disorder for children with two or more of these major symptoms at age two years and five years, though he said there's no conclusive evidence that those children develop autism earlier at the age they reach six to 10 years of age.", "length": 886, "ended": true}
{"id": 250420, "text": "In the past year, we have seen some significant progress, at first glance, in addressing the fundamental problems faced by the U.S. workforce. Most recently, we saw the biggest growth of U.S. workers, particularly the young and the younger.\n\nFor example, the number of young people ages 34-54 was up slightly from 4.6 million in 2007 to 4.6 million today. And while the percentage of young persons aged 50-64 was flat-lined from 16.4 percent in 2007 to 16.3 percent today, the percentage of those aged 65 years, 50-54, was up from 2.8 percent in 2007 to 2.3 percent today.\n\nThis growth has led to substantial changes to the work force. Over the last 20 years, at least 15.5 million unemployed Americans have had work experience that was lacking, and that is due in part to the work experience provided by these young people:\n\n\u2013 Employment and career advancement among adults ages 18-49.\n\n\u2013 Employment and career advancement among workers ages 20-44.\n\n\u2013 Employment and career advancement among workers ages 45-64.\n\n\u2013 Employment and career advancement among workers ages 65-74.\n\nOf these, the number of young people employed or working in full-time-year occupations declined more than 13%. That is largely attributable to those with a bachelor's degree (those with an undergraduate degree or greater) and an MBA.\n\nAt the same time, the work experience gained by these young people has grown substantially. In the last year, the percentage of young people in full-time employment grew from 13.6 percent to 17.6 percent.\n\nLooking at the economic impact of this growth, here's what we are seeing.\n\nWe estimate that the U.S. manufacturing sector will produce $30 billion in new jobs in 2016, an increase from previous years, and that this is likely to be the largest annual increase in output in decades. We also use a simple analysis of the effect of the jobs created by the last two years using a 2-year inflation-adjusted average across industries to estimate the effect in terms of employment growth, which is similar to the estimates that followed the Great Recession.\n\nAs well, as our findings show, companies in the manufacturing sector are using a lower-cost, fewer-senior workforce to move in and out of their headquarters or factories.\n\nWe are also seeing some real productivity gains, as a share of total payroll, the manufacturing sector's annual output increased.\n\nHowever, the number of young people using jobs outside of their engineering, computer and manufacturing capabilities remains at a peak and is expected to decline to 4 percent by 2018. In turn, this means that fewer skilled workers will enter the workforce. And, if we have our way, it will reduce employment for the U.S. economy, at a time when many businesses are struggling to find new employees.\n\nOverall, the jobless rate has improved in recent years, even as wages have stagnated.\n\nLooking ahead, though, the U.S. is also becoming more competitive at the workplace \u2014 particularly with businesses trying to raise their wages. As recently as last year, manufacturing jobs accounted for nearly 22 percent of total employment, with the number of manufacturing-related positions rising by nearly 10 percent, and those with hourly pay growth up about 10 percent.\n\nAnd as more industries enter the workforce and more employers try to raise rates, that will have greater effects on worker wages.\n\nFor example, in the past year alone, manufacturing jobs created $28.7 billion in new full-time worker jobs and the number of full-time workers increased by nearly a quarter, to 3.8 million in 2016. The percentage of these full-time workers has doubled, but the percentage has been flat for many of the last few decades.\n\nThat decline and change have led some companies to look for new workers by looking to pay more for their employees' wages, to improve the quality of hiring, to find new workers or to take on smaller, cheaper and more established locations.\n\nAs for the U.S. jobless rate, the U.S. economy has been getting better and better in recent years \u2014 with jobs growing faster and more people working more hours. But as the U.S. economy has continued to slow, we also see growing skepticism around the ability of employers to provide long-term employment to workers.\n\nIn other words, we are not quite at the point where the work force really has more bargaining power than it used to.\n\nTo be sure, there is talk of higher minimum wages for high-wage workers but only with a view to lower rates for lower-wage employers, which could mean bigger increases in federal and state job-training fees.\n\nSo, if those changes are a goal to help U.S. workers have more bargaining power, it seems unlikely that the U.S. economy will be able", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

And after months, months of hard work and a year of making it happen, I just said to myself, 'I don't want to write any more chapters on this.' Instead, I went on and on until it didn't matter. I felt obligated to make sure that everyone involved was fully committed to this effort, and to keep the process going indefinitely so that it wouldn't get derailed or that it wouldn't end like that. That was when things got difficult. I wanted to be sure that everyone was taking the same action for the greater good but not just to keep going.\"\n\nYour life is all too brief.

Today. I've read about it, I heard about it. That made me remember what I had done before and what I was going to do next. So that's when I realized I could do this project.

How much could have been done without the help of people doing the work. And what that means is that you could have been doing something completely unrelated to what had actually happened. No matter what happened, you would still have been able to finish up the chapter. You could have created something, but would have been distracted. But you could not have created what you created. This would have been totally meaningless, because that's all it means.\n\nI can never truly think with any certainty if you will not have to make the most of your chance to do something new or different. It is difficult when you are so focused on a project, like this one, that you can see that there is no other way, that they were just creating you.

I think that I had a difficult road, a very hard journey that I didn't go on.\n\nWhat we all have in common is that our lives are a journey that is very long. We love to travel with our loved ones, and we do it because of some great joy in discovering new places. This is part of what I'm trying to say, and I have to say it now, because I'm so proud of it.

What would be the greatest moments in Major League Baseball history. What sports teams would you look for in your organization's future?\n\nThe first and most daunting question I've ever had to tackle is the subject of being able to see these players, players at each position. It's true that there are a number of different approaches being looked into. But most folks don't take sports very seriously, and most people believe they will make an impact in the long run.\n\nIn baseball, we were lucky enough to have these great players in the lineup because baseball was our home and as a way to keep them out of trouble or to get rid of some guys that were having a long career in the game, it took about five years to accomplish most of those things.\n\nIt's important to take care of your players and keep them safe so that they're ready to play. As a sport, we're fortunate that our players stay healthy but our game is a very special game, and a game that a team can rely on every day.\n\nWhat was the first time you realized that when you had your eyes on a baseball moment?\n\nAt that time I was playing for a team in Arizona where they had a huge baseball team and it was a great time to be there. I wasn't playing for a big league team but I felt like I'd have a good opportunity to show them this year and I wanted to push myself to be better.\n\nWhen you were in college, did you realize the difference between being drafted No. 1, high school draftee or high school prospect?\n\nObviously, the first time I thought about college basketball in high school was in college. The second time was just going to school after basketball. We wanted to be in a major league team and I felt like I could be an All-Star team with our team. Now that I think this season we're in the playoffs, we're going to be a much better team.\n\nThe last time it was a part of my life was back in 2002 where I really wanted to be a coach, but I was told I needed to leave. I thought, \"Oh what do these athletes bring to the table? The coach gets that. And the players get their stuff. And I thought it wouldn't be that hard.\" But it wasn't until years went by that I knew I had to leave.\n\nWhat would you ever call the best moment in your life that took place while you were coaching football?\n\nThe most enjoyable moment I did was at the game against the Pittsburgh Pirates at the OAK Arena in 2003. The ball hit the right side of the field which meant that a batter called a foul on me and I fell backward on the turf. I had to get up to catch it but I was too scared to try again.\n\nAs far as having your eyes open for a moment in a sports moment or a game, I was going to make a choice that was not going to go anywhere for me, I wouldn't allow myself to be caught out of position, I would not give a single thought about how my future was going to play out with football, and it was a great way to take a couple weeks off and really focus on football and trying to get a couple more months out of it.\n\nWhat did you expect about the outcome of the game?\n\nIt was just great to watch. That first game it just felt real good. I was so proud of myself as an athlete and of my team that I went in at the top and I was a super-good kid. There wasn't much doubt but it had to happen again. If I took a break from football to try to put that team back on track, that day would be remembered very differently.\n\nWhat would you change if you took a vacation for the whole winter and got back to playing baseball?\n\nOne thing that I don't think about, really, is the vacation. If I don't play baseball, I'm going to have one very bad day and it would be that long. I would be forced to have a pretty hard day even against the best pitchers and all that stuff that I'd be forced to put up there.\n\nWhat was your favorite moment of high school basketball?\n\nWe played against the Chicago Bulls at home the night before, when they were 1-0 and I was sitting there and I could hear them singing my name, the whole game was pretty loud. In the locker room, I looked around for a place to play basketball if we needed one, but I couldn't find someone that was at my gym so I just left.\n\nWhat did you mean by \"in there\"?\n\nI thought", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

Stagg (1923-2013) who, after working as the field director of the Harvard Medical School and the University of Massachusetts Medical School for over a decade, began his own course on the human face. In this new book, published on January 25 and available in PDF form, Professor Stagg traces the history of research published before the face (human faces), and how their appearance and impact on society and civilization has expanded across different time periods. Stagg examines the human face's impact on biology, social behavior, and science. From a historical point of view, this book reveals the human face is a unique entity; it has been on the rise since at least as late as the 19th century, in terms of size, strength, and cultural organization, but has also, through their history and influence, become the predominant science in human history. Stagg's new book also reveals the evolution of the human face, a process that includes a major change between the early 20th century and the early 19th century. This transformation from a humanoid being from a single person to a multitudinous set of human species has occurred through many cultures, including the Americas, Australia, and elsewhere, and has been accompanied by changes in human physiology, cognition, physiology, and behavior. In this new study the Human Face is based on his new understanding of the biological and cultural influences of the human face. It is part of a multi-jurid history of human origins and development that he traces, along with many other issues in the history of human culture and biology, and in particular, human psychology. Stagg has built upon a comprehensive corpus of scientific studies that he has conducted in the past and present. Stagg focuses on the evolution of facial expressions, facial movements, and facial features, as well as on the human face's cultural, cultural, and behavioral roles and social relations that have changed over time. Stagg's book has been featured in many scholarly articles and news reports, for example, The Scientific American Magazine of the year 2013, and the Economist magazine of the year 2011. Stagg's work is particularly well-remembered, especially in the scientific field of paleontology and paleontology, for the great variety of analyses and discussions he shares with his colleagues across disciplines, such as human genetics, human development and society, paleontological anthropology, and paleontology and paleontology of all kinds. In this new book, he builds on the work of others, including his colleagues at Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and the University of Missouri. In this world, human face is not only a phenomenon of human thought and behaviour, but an individual and an entire civilization. This is why Stagg's book is so important to us all today. I am pleased to report that the Human Face, which he has created for the first time, is an important advance in our understanding of the human face, and is one of the most relevant and important study of the human face in our time. In his new book Dr. Stagg's work is a new way to understand the human face. In the past few months, as the name of my book has come under renewed scrutiny, I have been asked by many on social media why I am publishing the Human Face and in this way is a welcome welcome change in my approach to the human face. One is that Dr. Stagg is on the hunt for an evolutionary explanation and evolutionary explanation in the human face. He is taking on these difficult issues, particularly in the face of the global warming debate. He has been called an atheist, anti-science, a \"joke-bait,\" a \"doubt-monger,\" and more among others. His book is, I think, a huge success. The Human Face and the Science Itself By Dr. Stagg Introduction The Human Face First and foremost, and particularly the face in my book, the Human Face stands for human being. It is the face that is often considered too small or too small for the human face to even be a part of, or a \"shape.\" The Human Face is an incredibly large and complex face, which consists of hundreds, many, many layers of complex structures. It has no visible facial features. However, the human face was created for the purpose of defining and identifying human forms and behaviors. It became the defining feature of our culture, as well as a major part of human culture, for at least a long time. For over 10,000 years, there has been a process by which humans evolved to be able to make distinctions between two kinds of shapes and sizes", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

And she will tell her own life story, and there will be no impeachment proceedings.\"\n\nAs it happens, that's the sort of story you want to see as a GOP candidate. And it's a story that you're going to have to put up with for decades.\n\nIn a series titled \"How Obama Won,\" Lowe writes that his experience of winning races in Wisconsin, Iowa and Florida came up the hard way. That's when Lowe ran a story about Clinton getting an endorsement from Governor Rick Perry. According to Lowe, Perry endorsed Clinton, but he left the state for Texas in 2010 \"due to lack of enthusiasm\" for a GOP opponent with strong social media following.\n\nIn short, a friend of mine wrote Lowe's piece from Pennsylvania. Lowe took the story to his friend, Rick Perry, and gave a few brief quotes before sending Lowe off to write something bigger for his audience.\n\n\"He made the mistake of being a Republican because he is the only Democrat on the state ballot in any given year and he knew this was an idea that he was trying to sell,\" Lowe told CNN Money. \"That said, he did try to build one of the biggest campaigns in U.S. history; you can't really argue with the idea that he will get a Republican nomination. I think he'll get a little nervous, but he will put out a very strong message that he wants to win a Republican primary.\"\n\nThat's what a lot of people might imagine.\n\nBut if you're like me, you'll know how quickly you become confused on how to interpret Lowe's quote. And it's not just that you're having trouble in your own right. Lowe is correct that Hillary Clinton's campaign is not going to do well if it wants to be seen as a genuine challenger, but it's very clear that the media, and especially the left, should be given more attention when it comes to issues like social issues.\n\nThis was no easy thing to do with an online campaign, and Lowe points out that online issues have done better in the past than in a traditional campaign. And that was his approach for the last few weeks.\n\n\"On the night of Hillary Clinton's debate with Donald Trump, a few of the most egregious examples in the history of the political world are over Twitter. The left is still the most important force working to stop Hillary Clinton from becoming a national standard-bearer; there's an entire section of Hillary Clinton's supporters who are trying to change the way the media portrays Clinton,\" Lowe wrote. \"But the right is going to get the bigger show and get on the side of it with their new platform and its appeal to an older, older constituency.\"\n\nHere's the part he's talking about with the Washington Post.\n\nI think it's going to change. When I look at the Republican nominee and see all the crazy things that he's proposed and he hasn't done, I think I see a lot of things that are going to get worse as the campaign goes along and the Clinton campaign gets more and more committed to supporting him at every turn. Then I think we all see how stupid he is and how much, if any, power he has in the system that he's been running.\n\nYou'd think the media would give the Clintons less attention and less coverage, but the more it's done, the more it's become obvious how much more they would have trouble getting there. And that's why you see the left getting more desperate in trying to distance themselves from Hillary Clinton. It's because the media won't even bother to explain how it happened. It's simply all part of how they pretend the Republican candidates are all stupid and they don't understand what's going on.\n\nIt's something I think every media industry should be doing to be in sync. So I have to ask a question again because this is something that a lot of media and media organizations have struggled with for years: Will there be a mainstream Republican presidential front man this year?

So first thing's first, so I wanted to get you into context about my legal background, so I just made an example of the situation where a client asks me what he was going to do with something he's got and I say, \"Well, he's getting a legal defense and I want him to get a judgment.\" And I think I get that the second part and the first thing in that is that I'm going to figure out a way to get him to get a judgment.\n\nBut to think that he doesn't need a judgment is a lie. They just come and go. If you have an agreement with me that you've got all this legal stuff in your life that you don't know about, you just have no idea that you're being asked about something you didn't know about. And you could've turned that lie into something that you didn't want to say. Because you know that I don't believe in anything being called legal. If you have a lawsuit, you're talking about a lawsuit. That's what we're going to do, we're going to give you a judgement and just give you a legal representation.\n\nI guess I have the second part. I know there's some people that feel like I don't care who won. And I'm going to say it again, you don't even have to care. And you do have your legal problems that aren't about something so important, but they have nothing to do with legal issues. And I'm going to say that I think it's probably a lie to say that that's what you are. I do realize that the fact that that's exactly what you're saying is a lie that I don't believe. I think it probably is a lie to say that there are two types of people and that's the second type of people we're talking about. I think when that happens, you can be totally wrong. Let me tell you a different story. That's why this, I don't think I've been lying to that person. If people are going to want to see a case that's wrong, let me tell you why I'm lying to them. If you look at all the evidence to me, I wouldn't say I'm lying. I'm just trying to tell you what I know about the case and in fact I'm giving some evidence that I would rather not give to some people, but I can tell you it doesn't have to be that way.\n\nSo now, as I get into the second sentence, what I think is important is that the legal system should not be used by someone who's trying to tell you something, to actually make a judgment and I just think the first part, I just think that there should be some basic fairness in what is going to be done here, the third, I think the most important thing is to make sure that what you think is fair and that the laws should not be used by those who want to tell you something that is not so in their good interests as to be of benefit to them personally, and that should be a right. I love, trust me on that one, but I feel like it's an unfair system because the more you have it, the more the system will change. And again, I'm talking about it to give the legal system an opportunity to get some sort of fairness.\n\nQ: I think that there's actually a problem. You were doing that, I have no idea what you did in that position; I don't think you did anything with those documents, that's all. But I just want to get you to understand the problem.\n\nA: All right, thank you, everybody. One of the things that I like to get people to understand about this is that people don't like people that are going to do something about legal issues like we have with the Ferguson investigation. What was the response back then?\n\nAnd the response to Ferguson seems to have been somewhat to say, \"That's what you're saying, you're wrong,\" but then I think some of that had actually changed since then. But you know what? I didn't do that", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 250439, "text": "\nSitting in his office one morning at the Justice Department briefing room, the head of Russia's intelligence agency met this afternoon with officials from the Justice Department, one of the main US media organizations, and asked him if there was anything the Obama team learned about the \"Russian intervention.\" The conversation went like this:\n\nDirector Clapper: You need to get over your mistakes the FBI made regarding the election, right, not just about the election but about the campaign that is being waged on it by the people of this country.\n\nClapper: I said they're going to start to look at it. And they've been doing that for years.\n\nComey: Is this new behavior you see a good thing?\n\nNova: Yes, if you look at the things that were coming up for a very long time. That's what we were getting back from the Senate and the FBI on and on. Just the fact that you saw this and see what was going on in Washington and what the president did was something that's been, I think, unprecedented in recent history.\n\nBannon: You know, the most important message being put out to the American public is to stop and listen. Stop it right now.\n\nBut we have a problem.\n\nBecause if you listen to the FBI and the intelligence community, even with the intelligence community's lack of confidence, they have the evidence to say, \"We have a story to tell regarding the election.\" And the media, just think about that.\n\nNo way in hell do you even get information like this from outside the FBI, from outside the intelligence community, from outside the agencies, and from inside their families, their government\u2026\n\nClapper: I mean, this, you know, it's almost like, okay, let's make sure we really tell the truth. Let's get to the truth.\n\nNo way in hell do you even get information like this from outside of the FBI, from outside the intelligence community, from outside their families, their government.\n\nWhat a way to end this whole political process for Russia and Russia-as-a-national-security threat.\n\nClapper: You have to stop listening.\n\nNova: No way in hell do we ever get information like this from our intelligence agencies, from our media, from outside our government and from behind all those doors that are open, and we're going to tell the American public how it has been doing.\n\nClapper: Well, that's right. I'm sorry.\n\nSo you're saying, \"We have a problem.\" This is not happening. But what is the truth? So, in just what can you say to this President?\n\nHere's what happened to Donald Trump: He's been forced to defend his wiretap decisions, saying Trump is simply wrong on this issue. That's what happened. What happened was that you went to a sitting President on the same television show and decided that if a question was brought to your attention by a citizen who was asked an extraordinarily important question by a journalist, a reporter who may have had some intelligence, if you asked him an even higher question, which is this particular issue, there's no need to look to the intelligence community or the political establishment or to the Justice Department to really understand it. You just can't. You can't have the FBI look at something from its own documents. You can't. You can't even have this person, the intelligence community look at something that they know is wrong, and in order to actually stop this, you have to know what is going on.\n\nIf you're going to find some piece of evidence of collusion by your own administration and then go back to what we knew, you can do it all over again. The same guy, again, he was told, \"Now don't look at, you're lying.\" He was told for years that they knew everything. This guy was told, \"Oh, they know everything. What did they do to you today? Don't even look. They lied to you.\" He says this and that.\n\nIn fact, it is that same guy who is told, he's told for years with this guy, he's lied to you every time you asked him that question. And that's exactly what he was told during that campaign. He said that he saw in the classified documents what he called an act of collusion between the intelligence community and the candidate. And he said that this guy was told this same thing at a time and again. This guy was told, \"If this guy calls you an agent, you're doing it right at that time, and you should never ask a question about it.\" But it's precisely in that same episode with Trump that he is denied, under oath, this particular case.\n\nWhat did you find that you want to end?\n\nNova: I don't think that's any good. This is the most important question that we're going", "length": 1024, "ended": false}
{"id": 250440, "text": "\nYou could have found my story, about a man's relationship to religion at work, on another blog, or from the Huffington Post.\n\nInstead, I decided to tell you that of course there's one big difference between \"A Church of Christ\" and \"A Christian Society.\" It's just a better word.\n\nThe idea is simple. \"A Christian Society\" is a collection of Christian clubs, many of them religious, in which men can work toward the same goal of social, economic, and political equality.\n\nSo, if you're religious, you should go out into the world for fun and have fun. Or if you've never studied Christianity, you don't need to. But you shouldn't have to \u2014 and that's totally okay. You just have to find good places to be.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the Christian ideal is to have fun \u2014 and have a great life. Yes, that's actually really what a Christian society is all about, right?\n\nSo, the best way to get this out there is to come to God, get married, have fun, and be great.\n\nWell, it won't happen overnight, but it'll get easier.\n\nFor example, I recently moved back home to New Jersey for the holidays. A year or two ago, I decided I needed a change. I read a book, tried out for a fellowship or a fellowship at a Christian organization for a year, and then started looking for opportunities to get involved in my life.\n\nThis was very difficult for me.\n\nIn my life, I didn't know what to do with my life. And I wanted to go home and change my life. I was trying desperately to find something that I could do with myself.\n\nBut I had found something I wasn't really in. Something I could love in a loving, happy way. In the last month of my life, I had changed everything for the better. I was moving up in my life. And I was happy. And I was making progress.\n\nI moved back home with my husband and children to the U.S. in 1995. We did two weeks at a time for two years. And then a few years later, one of our kids was married. We didn't know what to do with him.\n\nAfter our divorce, I decided to try working for a company that had done the work of my life.\n\nAnd after working for the last couple years, I decided I would give it my all for my life and for the world, not just for myself, but for my family and future.\n\nThere are many benefits to working for a company that is dedicated to giving you the freedom to feel and act as you want, but at the end of the day, you just have to do what you want.\n\nSo here's my story: I was hired at a Christian organization and it got really fun. I have a very low level of income. I have a wife, family, and child. It all just takes time! When I first went to work, I was always out of breath, but my wife, who was on vacation, gave me her blessing. Every day that I went work, she would ask if I would like to take my dog to the park, and that was exactly what I did.\n\nShe would be the first person I ever sat down to have her take your dog for a walk and make a point to do something. She was very supportive and loving. She was also very gracious. When she would call and say, \"Hi, look,\" I would smile at her and thank her and go home.\n\nAnd just like every wife, there was always a moment when everyone was giving her a positive look. And it is that one moment that makes this life so hard for me.\n\nThis makes me sick. This makes me sick of everyone else with whom I share a house and a life, and this makes me mad.\n\nBut now I don't know one person from my family, that's for sure.\n\nI have been a couple of months off from work.\n\nAnd my wife, who I love dearly, is also in the hospital with another disease called a heart attack. My wife told me to come home, because this is one day when she will go home and watch over me from my bed. And this is the last moment before my wife will go home. And I am so grateful I know that she will.\n\nBecause of this, I decided to go home for the week and meet my wife and her family again to see them from their hospital bed. And she will spend two days with me while they are in the hospital. (I had to go back to work a day later to check on her after that visit.)\n\nI was so happy because of my wife. She's so caring, and she had a great family as well \u2014 and I want to add to that that she's", "length": 1024, "ended": false}
{"id": 250441, "text": "It's a little weird to talk about this kind of thing with a girl but I'm starting to get a bit tired of this sort of stuff that I've been talking about a few times.\n\nFor now I'm just going to start the conversation with the topic of the vagina.\n\nNow I'm going to get a little bit deeper and the fact that it's a pretty big one is not being mentioned here. It wasn't mentioned before when I first started dating a girl.\n\nMy best friend got married on the internet and his father had already been married for years but he didn't really have it coming into his mind. His mother is a professional nurse and it was her duty to get his dad out of retirement. My father and my sister had never met, not that I'm saying they weren't friends.\n\nSo I was just thinking, \"Oh yeah, it gets into weird conversations, but I don't think I'd ever say that about that kind of man.\"\n\nI was like, \"What do you mean?\"\n\nSo my mom told me she thinks that I probably wouldn't even have asked about that subject to begin with. She told me they had actually had a pretty nice time chatting about it with my parents and it was nice.\n\nIt was a fun time in my life for me. I had met all sorts of really fun and high achiever friends who were both in college (I guess they used to be from San Diego when I was growing up).\n\nAnd they were like, \"That's it! You're going to be getting back together with your dad and mother. You're having fun, all the while listening to music because we're playing the video game Star Wars right now.\"\n\nIn the end it's pretty hard finding people who really value your parents and their hard work. It doesn't matter that you have a really important, interesting career like this. It's a weird little thing that goes together.\n\nI'm sure it sounds strange, but people get into this sort of stuff, too. For instance, the guy who I date on Facebook is from the US. In his profile picture, he's like \"Hey my roommate is from California. Her name is Lauren, he is a great musician and photographer, he's one of my closest friends.\"\n\nSo that's where it starts. I don't know if you'll realize it right away, but at some point he comes over to my car to take a photo with me on the road in Los Angeles and he says, \"Hey what's going on, did you have a good time and I'm taking pictures for you.\" Like, it's so weird to him to do.\n\nHe's like, \"Hey, it went alright! So I'm going to take some pictures of your car so I can make sure everyone knows you live out there when you're not around.\"\n\nThen he takes those pictures and he's like, \"Wow, so you do like to take pictures. Thanks.\"\n\nAnd that was an incredible experience for me. I don't think I've ever been in my whole life that hadn't been from California.\n\nSo it's definitely a strange little thing. It's very strange to me.\n\nIt's kind of like a small step, but it makes me happy and so glad that he had this chance. I feel good about this and have great life. And I'm really happy.\n\nOh I had a real good time.\n\nThanks a lot Lauren.\n\nAnd thanks a lot to my sister, who gave it her all.\n\nI have a great, long story next.\n\nIt's been a few years since I heard from you. It's still weird, but I'm glad I'm not getting too much of it but I'm glad you found this and I don't want to get too old-fashioned.\n\nBecause I feel like it's just nice to be back so old. I hope I didn't get too attached to my dad for the whole world to see.\n\nI can't explain it, but the way my mom tells you this story does make it interesting, when she first met me. I remember my little girl, really shy, was about 14 when I met her. It was a little weird.\n\nI think you're lucky she met you. I suppose it's true about her. But I guess it all works out for now.\n\nAnd I know there won't be too much of this story in a few days.\n\nOkay. Well maybe a month may go by and maybe not.\n\nIt's a little strange to me that there aren't any more posts. I'm just trying to get to the bottom of it.\n\nThis is part 2 of a two-part series on dating and how to be dating the right person to ensure that you can be the best you can be.

{"id": 250442, "text": "Grow Your Own!\n\nBy Gwen Bracknell\n\nWhy would anyone want to grow their own food?\n\nWell, some may want to grow their own food but those who grow their own food want to do it for more time as well as money! It is a great way to live and grow your own food, especially when it comes to growing your own food as some might say a \"salty\" concept\u2026or just an \"expensive\" food\u2026.it can be done well for a living and do well for everyone else's food. However, as the growing food business becomes more complex it becomes easier to grow your own food if you get into that situation.\n\nMy experience on the farm has not been any different. I grew our first food in a growing field and then bought a large quantity of fresh produce for my family. I was able to grow our food myself and the family used to eat it all day without any problems. In fact, I even had food with a good \"no fuss\" attitude that I did not want others to be upset about.\n\nMany people like to say growing your own is just like being \"bored\". Not all grow eaters are like this\u2026..you live your life a certain way and there is no need to be bothered about being \"bored\". Your \"body\" is still what it is and you can easily take responsibility for it. There are many examples of growing food that others do not like and then selling them as it grows. I would be delighted if I could help to create a food factory for people who like to do a small amount of different things to grow their own food.\n\nThere are many people with small budgets and could not buy from me. This is because I do not like selling food. I do this because they do not like how I do things. I do this because I am making money and this is where I do most of my income. I am doing this for the same thing every couple of weeks. You mustn't take my money for the same reason or you won't see me doing it. And that's exactly what I am doing. I am selling my food for others who like it the most. I do this to provide more jobs for my children, my wife and me. I am selling my own food because they don't like the way my money is being spent every year.\n\nWhy should I buy my food at the restaurant that comes out to lunch?\n\nBecause you can choose how you buy your food at a restaurant. You can use what you are given. Your food or other products that are used as part of your daily meals will get your own brand name, price or price tags when a person buys it. Also, my food will be on sale at your place for the next few months on the restaurant menu.\n\nWhat is the difference between a fast and low-carb burger?\n\nI like to call some fast and some low carb burgers the fast. The idea behind this is to give your food extra flavors when you have food in your mouth (I like to call it the \"chicken salad\").\n\nI believe our food is made from 100% natural ingredients. A lot has to happen to make these foods taste good. We need to use natural ingredients in our food making. The key to making our food taste good is the ability to absorb all of our nutrients. This means that only when our food is eaten properly can it become whole. After that it may take a long time until we get to full. The main thing for this burger is the way we make it. The bun itself is actually made from only 1 piece of natural flour. This flour is then mixed with a few of our own herbs and spices. The idea is to only add a bit of the extra nutrition to this food. When used to make our food, it tastes great.\n\nThere are many things that contribute to the quality of your burger. Our burger is very low on carbs because our food comes in lots of natural ingredients and no preservatives or preservatives. The main component of our hamburger comes in a few different types of sugar. Sugar is also found in certain vegetables, fruits and nuts. The main type of sugar is beta-glucan, which is found in your milk and is a major protein that helps you build muscle faster. This is added by you on a daily basis to help build insulin.\n\nI like the idea that we give it extra flavor or that it tastes good when we are cooking it. It does not taste like a bad burger. You can go a mile without that taste of protein in your burger.\n\nWhy should I change or change my food choice?\n\nWell, this might seem like the \"change\" that you hear people say. It does not have to be this way. When I want a burger I usually want my burger to be about 8\u2033 tall and in a good shape. If that is not good it is time to try a new", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 250444, "text": "Pamela Kline says they'd still need to send money from other banks to help. (AP)\n\nA few days ago, we published a report by the Institute of Directors about how the National Bank of China and its counterparties are getting preferential treatment from the U.S.-based Federal Reserve, while U.S. banks are being forced to shut down. (The news was first reported at the time.) The Fed and the U.S. Central Bank are also not doing much better, in that they are being asked more than they have been under previous presidents. The idea that the Fed is sending banks money by way of preferential treatment is not new. In fact, it seems that there is not one single time that the Fed has made a substantial or significant impact without the approval of American taxpayers.\n\nWe asked banks in these parts of China to provide their full names \u2014 for us to follow-up as we got more information from their banks in the U.S. and China.\n\nAccording to the report, the main Chinese bank that was asked was GGB Capital. The company is listed on the US Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's website.\n\nGGB says it \"has significant assets as well as a growing share base at the bank.\" That does not mean the Chinese are simply giving the banks preferential treatment. They are, however, making many more concessions this time around.\n\nWhen the U.S. Treasury Department raised the $100 million in new regulations that require all the banks, including large ones like GGB, to provide loans to foreigners and foreign institutions, banks and government institutions were given permission to do not only those transactions, but also to provide loans to American investors. All the while the country in question was not the one paying the loans.\n\nThe report notes that the new rules also require that the banks also be able to issue bonds as collateral in order to pay dividends.\n\n\"There are also certain additional fees that banks must pay to repay U.S. Government loans that it has secured as collateral. According to an official statement from GGB Capital on Monday, this \"will apply broadly over time\" to \"asset-backed securities, which tend to have a net return on assets if fully repaid.\" That was an odd statement \u2014 to say the least. Given that the U.S. Treasury is supposed to do their own lending, it should not be hard to see what the Fed is doing.\n\nThis means that while the US and other international banks will no longer have to get permission from the Fed and U.S. government companies to lend, they will still have to make concessions. They may simply have to comply with American law by making loans to other large or small banks.\n\nThe report, meanwhile, also notes that if the banks go broke and have to close out, they will have to wait for the U.S. government to come along. That could mean waiting for some form of bailout of global financial markets such as the ones that are now subject to the new rules, or some form of deal that would help those struggling economies and even the people in them to recover from their most dire economic situation.\n\nHow would that work? We'll get to that when we talk about a recent piece from Bloomberg that discussed how the U.S. had been struggling with its \"loan crisis,\" and this may surprise you. The report notes that since 2001, GGB has been forced to repay $6 billion per year for losses in its home equity derivatives portfolios, which were the primary driving factor behind the $12 billion or so in losses the Fed took to bail out GGB.\n\nOf course, this is going to not seem like a good idea for the U.S. and its allies to put out.\n\nBut they are being asked to do so by their governments. These loans have already been approved and repaid to the Treasury by the Federal Reserve. GGB Capital has also said to Treasury that they will no longer need to do anything to pay back $1 billion they took to pay out the government for mortgage-financed mortgages, which were to come without any government subsidy.\n\nAs for the Obama administration, they may have to explain their refusal to allow the same types of debt relief offered to large credit card firms, and the fact that the U.S. did not participate in the 2008 recession by allowing these government-funded bailout programs.\n\nHowever, there are two interesting possibilities on this. The first is that the Feds will ask the Federal Reserve not to impose additional requirements for any business that is required by the new rules to comply. That is, they want to make sure that banks cannot make profits in this activity.\n\nThe second possibility is that it's just plain silly for the Feds to suggest that the banks be allowed to do something about these loans in the first place, and they just can't possibly get approval from the Treasury.

{"id": 250445, "text": "The second game of 2012 is due out this coming off a rough year of competitive Hearthstone, and a lot of you are probably wondering just what to expect and when to expect it. It's a game designed to give players different tools they can leverage to quickly build their deck and win tournaments online. This is a game that features several different decks and multiple abilities in a competitive setting, but for those looking to jump into the ladder it is a great way for those of us who don't have the inclination for the traditional card gaming aspect of Hearthstone to get into it.\n\n\nThe first part of the deck is called \"Tronk\".\n\nNow this is one of the deck's best moves at a lot of different moments, such as a few turn 2 damage-free plays like Bloodtusk out of nowhere or a 3/2 kill to get back on board one. You'll often go in for a 2 health kill like Dimir, Dark Iron and any other 2 drops which can be lethal to a Priest player who could otherwise win the game with no risk of the card going to hand. For a Priest player who is struggling so much and has to play extremely careful against 1 mana minions, this may mean a 2/1 play or a 3/2 in turn 2 which is quite a threat to a 1/1 play.\n\nThe second part of the deck is called \"Twig of Tusk\".\n\nI've found there really is no substitute to playing this deck. When you can actually make use of that little bit of power that has been provided by your minions it gives you a ton of extra flexibility to play different builds of cards with different strategies which can then become good at different situations.\n\n\nSome of the cool features are:\n\n- 5+ attack, for a 2 mana minions\n\n- 6+ fire damage for a 3 mana minion\n\n- 4-1 charge for a minion that is actually a 2/2 on turn three\n\n- 5+ 1 attack for a 3 mana minion\n\n- 4/3 charge with a 4/2 on turn three\n\n- 6% damage for a 3 minion\n\n- 2 additional life for a minion with 3 Health\n\n\nAnother important feature is:\n\n- 4 unique cards to choose from to support you as you move throughout the deck\n\n- 4 4 turn 1 damage\n\n- 2 of these cards to turn 2. 4 on turn three.\n\n- 6 1 mana mana cost.\n\nSo the deck has a lot of great options in how it goes about going about it, but with so much to offer, sometimes it's difficult to follow up on your first play and even harder to tell what was in there for it while your opponent was having them cast. That's where the new \"Stoke the Flames\" mechanic takes advantage of this.\n\nAfter some reading, I think what makes the Smoke Barter a great piece of equipment for this deck is what it comes with. The unique cards that the Smoke Barter brings into play can be seen in the following videos:\n\nThis is in contrast to what the most popular and popular decks in the meta have to offer, the Smoke Barter can be seen as an alternative to the \"Fiery War Axe\" spell that just comes out at the beginning of your curve as it's not even considered a full cost item like it was before. The effect is pretty simple, but I find it incredibly strong as it helps to remove certain pieces of the match before they get their chance to come back from the dead. You will see some cards like Flamestand in these videos that don't fit the standard curve, but the fact that this can be used to make the game more interesting, even for a slightly weaker deck that hasn't run enough damage, and more importantly I think that the smoke barters are one of the best decks to play with, and if there was one thing that can help the deck achieve that success is how it can add so much value for the game.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with deck mechanics like Burning Wish, this mechanic has been introduced to the archetype at a very small point in the meta. You can expect an average build which has been put through multiple iterations until the end of the game where it is completely unplayable. This means that your players can go crazy and kill yourself. You get to add and remove a ton of stats as players try to outplay your deck for a good bit of time. The build has to continue to gain tempo, so when you get close to losing you will quickly end the turn and the build will be out of control. The reason why this is a major advantage over the others is that you can get your hands on a good value-hungry deck in a competitive environment after you have done things like, get it to a point where its been pretty good on and off the ladder before and even before the first draft had even begun.\n\nIt also means that all of the build mechanics are great.

Not that I didn't see it at all. We made a tackle and if we hit any guys on first step, then he was up front. If he had gotten out there and put the time in to get there, my first thought would have been: 'Dude, I might break that field goal down,' which it was,\" Bryant said.\n\nBryant didn't like the idea of a play like the one he caught.\n\n\"You are seeing plays like this, I don't know if I thought this was what it should be,\" he said.\n\nIt isn't the first time a game goes horribly wrong. The Cowboys made a huge saving call late in Saturday's 24-23 win over Oakland that led to a touchdown pass from Romo. But by that point in the season, they were in third place in the NFC South.\n\nWatson, who caught seven passes for 120 yards and a touchdown, said it wasn't particularly good. When Bryant hit a post route on a third-down pass play, he was intercepted by Dallas linebacker Terence Newman. It was Bryant's fifth reception of the game.\n\n\"We are the third-leading tacklers in the league and they had no intention of getting sacked in a first-quarter game after we made one of the biggest plays of the game in the first half,\" Romo said. \"DeMarcus was able to get the ball over the top at the point he needed to. He was just able to take care of himself. I think he just caught a pass, it wasn't a missed pass. That is what he was about to give people and hopefully at that point, everybody will be wondering if they caught anything or not. Obviously, he could have done it. He could have gotten more attention on the play. Hopefully the referees made the appropriate call and caught it. I think if they didn't catch it, there would have been more questions because we would have given them a chance, too.\"\n\nThe fact that Bryant caught Romo was no surprise to him.\n\n\"It will not get too much talked about,\" Bryant said. \"I don't think it is the case at all. I don't know. He probably got more attention than I do. I'm just happy for him not to talk about it.\n\n\"It does hurt, obviously, too. All of a sudden, if you look at where he (Dallas) have been and the number of penalties they have (tried to prevent), it is a huge blow. If you look at it, you look at the actions they have taken. If you look at the amount of time they have spent on trying to stop the guy on third-and-8 and getting one for a third-down TD pass in the fourth or fifth quarter, it is something that hurt that much more then anything. And the fact is when they had got that penalty, it was a huge blow. I'm not going to go through what that is like now. This is how we are. It is just a big one. The whole game just went from a lot of positive to not much more positive, to this huge one.\n\n\"You do not forget it too much about this situation.\"\n\nThe Cowboys need to figure things out with Romo off the field now.

It's a very popular game in North America, but since it's such a big hit in North America, it's actually going to have a hard time getting it to play well on its own.\n\nWhile there is some controversy for me as I mentioned in my review, the \"game\" that you described is clearly not The Witcher 3. That is, if you're playing around with a few people it is an example of two games that would play well in the same role, if not more of them so it's hard to draw any conclusions.\n\nWhen it was first announced, it was already the first game I would want to play a thousand times to try and make it my own, while The Witcher had no concept of what it was. I know you all do, this is how I met this idea in 2007 when, as I was playing another game, I suddenly found myself wondering how far could the game go in a game that didn't have some kind of storyline around it. That just didn't sit right with me.\n\nI know what it's like when you play another game and you play it on your PC. You have to watch the video of each person you play play, especially as they watch the game on your hard drive. When they're playing on their PC, that's a huge amount of power wasted because they are sitting in their console, while there's nothing they can do with their power, they are on a platform with minimal data. This power is literally wasted. It's just too much, and I could see myself having to go to a lot of times to play something different than I expected to.\n\nThe Witcher 3 looks like it will be much more than just another example, this will be the kind of game that we've all been waiting around for before we start making this decision. We are going to see a very different world to make from The Witcher 3, and I will be very thankful I spent some time with it.\n\n[Editor's Note: I mentioned previously that while not a game that would be played by all of Skyrim fans, it will still represent a very large portion of the population that enjoys Skyrim in some way.]", "length": 474, "ended": true}

{"id": 250453, "text": "It's been almost a year since Apple introduced its iPhone for sale in North America. The last time I checked, the iPhone 1 was the best phone I bought at the time. I was in New York and was trying to get a deal on an iPhone that I already had in stock. For that reason alone, it has made me smile and feel much more comfortable in the iPhone market today than it did at some point in the recent past.\n\nI'd like to tell you why people are happier with their iPhone in the eyes of Apple and not with my new iPhone.\n\nThis is a little trick I discovered while using a new iPhone. This is a \"new year pass.\"\n\nThis is the magic ingredient you have to buy your new iPhone in the U.S. to take it to the store. Even though a few weeks is no guarantee of a great deal on your new iPhone, most people will say when they need to pick up the newest iPhone to use, no matter what the phone is.\n\nThe reason is simple: because of a new year, you're able to use the new iPhone right when you don't have them anymore and just as quickly as if it were sitting there. The difference lies with the size of the new iPhone. Even as a 2.1-inch, dual-core iPhone, those extra 3.5mm sensors can often take several weeks for you to figure out what your old iPhone is doing. To understand this, let's take a look at my two iPhone and 2.2-inch devices:\n\nNow, back a few weeks ago, I was trying to get my 1st iPhone to the store through the free promotion that Apple offered. The best part is that I had a new iPhone that day \u2014 a 4.9-inch 5s with Touch ID. So that's another good reason I am more excited about my first iPhone sale in the future.\n\nNow, to be honest, the one thing I didn't love about buying my first new iPhone is the \"free\" promotion. The iPhone is a piece of software, but it's only a piece of software. In fact, it's only been a year, and in many respects, the iPhone is no longer necessary because of a good reason.\n\nWith a 4.9-inch iPhone, you're probably aware that the first thing that you want from your phone \u2014 not just in design, but in size \u2014 is a fingerprint sensor and 2GB of Flash memory. But I'm not really happy about using my old iPhone for things as simple as this. I can't even touch my old iPhone like a normal iPhone. When I'm trying to find a good deal on my iPhone, I'll find it at the first opportunity.\n\nA Good Deal\n\nFor a few weeks that we spent trying to find an iPhone deal for, we tried various deals that the iPhone was available in to. Most of the items we tried were from a reputable company \u2014 Samsung, Dell, etc. We went through a selection of different sellers for the iPhone and some were just as good, but you could tell they were the same guy.\n\nThe great thing about having a good deal is that you actually get to choose what deal you want on the day you open it and who you'll be dealing with at the store.\n\nWhen you spend a lot of time trying different deals online, you can see a clear differentiation when you do it from when you buy it: You're getting the iPhone right. Your best price on a new iPhone is a lot lower than with an older one. A lot. It is.\n\nWhen you're shopping, you're spending most of your time searching for the best deal and doing it in a way that is fair and fair by comparison. When you buy something that's pretty good and pretty good to start with, you may not be finding the best deal because of what you're doing at the moment.\n\nThis is also important to remember: your smartphone will not be a new thing anytime soon. For a few years, when the iPhone was first on the market, the iPhone used to be a brand new device, a product that wasn't expected. Now it's a new product that's almost as expected, and Apple wants to keep it that way even if that means you're going to see more iPhones.\n\nMy second iPhone was a 4.8-inch 4.9-inch. It was also about 6.9 mm wide in size \u2014 a lot smaller than my older iPhone. We started our shopping with a 7:9 aspect ratio and I was about to try a new iPhone \u2014 a 5.1-inch iMac and a small, 10.9-inch iPod touch.\n\nIn this new order, my new iPhone was a 4.8-inch 4.9-inch with Touch ID. That was only enough size for a 10.9-inch iPhone and I would have to try something different just to know that it wasn't going to be", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 250455, "text": "There are a few reasons to think there is a correlation when comparing two kinds of genes, but there are also a number of factors that make it easier to know what you are looking for.\n\nThe Genetic Correlation (GPC) is an average of genes, genes that have similar proportions in the two kinds of animals, but are genetically related. This is true for all the major species of fish, including salmon.\n\nAnd there is only one exception to the genetic correlation - echinoderms, the largest fish species worldwide that are not related to humans by genetic lineage.\n\nWhat is the Genetic Correlation\n\nEchinoderms (called \"fish\" in English when the two are synonymous) have a fairly simple and common ancestor of E. coli; E. coli is an organism with an extra cell of DNA.\n\nSo the two types of fish share a common ancestor that would make them similar. That is, E. coli evolved as a common ancestor of E. coli with the same number of organisms.\n\nIf you consider that E. coli is very small, this means about one-thousandth the number of E. coli organisms.\n\nSo if both species are unrelated, a genetic correlation can be formed.\n\nIt follows that a gene is a product of multiple alleles of common ancestor for a number of reasons, but also of one kind for all the other kind.\n\nFor example, if one gene is a key factor for your food and you are looking for a particular dish, you need to find a specific gene that matches one or more genes of the key type in that dish.\n\nYou also need to find a gene that is very small for a common ancestor of E. coli, the echinoderms echinoderms Echinobacterialus (E. coli).\n\nE. coli also seems to be very specific about itself - it is what a plant is known for, which also happens to be the most common type.\n\nWhat's important to note\n\nBut as mentioned previously, the genes are related. So the genetic correlations aren't that great for E. coli and echinoderms.\n\nIn fact, the genetic correlations are what we don't need to know about any of these species unless we are looking for it in the food they do produce.\n\nBut here's the thing - there are two very different types of fish in the world. There is E. coli - E. coli shares all the common genes, and E. coli is similar to E. coli in that it shares all the common genes with E. coli in that it shares all the common genes with that E. coli is not a bacterial species.\n\nAnd there are the other species of echinoderms, echinobacteriaceae (echinoderms that can be split up into some types of E. coli and E. coli).\n\nSo the genetic correlations aren't very strong here.\n\nBut what you do know is that E. coli and E. coli come in a lot of varieties. If you look carefully you will see that the echinoderms come in many varieties - some quite large (e.g. 6.5 m), others very small, others very small even (e.g. 1 m).\n\nThere are, however, two kinds of genetic correlations that allow you to understand which one you are looking for.\n\nThe Genetic Correlation (GPC)\n\nA good example of how a gene interacts with another is that of a fungus. But in E. coli a fungus is called echinoderms - the echinodermic fungus.\n\nEchinoderms are very distinctive, and E. coli often comes in so many different varieties that this genetic correlation really can help you determine which one fits your needs better.\n\nIn this example you probably don't want to compare a particular species to other species, but it may help a little.\n\nFor instance, if that species is looking for some kind of fungus that helps you distinguish it from its other type of echinoderms, it will be better to find a fungus on the genus of fungus, E. coli.\n\nAs you can see from that example, the gene gene for your food, E. coli, gets shared within E. coli, so E. coli shares its genes.\n\nYou just look at it, you make your own choices in how you wish to see it, and you'll know which one you prefer.\n\nAnd for that reason we can think and communicate more effectively with E. coli than with a common ancestor of E. coli that is different.\n\nIf E. coli is the most common E. coli, you may have found that its parent, E. coli, shares some genes that are common to E. coli, and that's the kind of E. coli you want to be looking for.\n\nOne good example of having this kind of genetic", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 250458, "text": "\nThis guide may make you or someone else feel better about your marriage, but the majority of its advice in that world may not be.\n\nIf the above are enough to convince you to quit your marriage then go right ahead; the problem lies more with what makes you and your spouse more than what makes you and your spouse less. In fact, for most of us, \"the best predictor of how much we like our partners\" is not our relationship, and may not even be a good indicator of how much you dislike your partner.\n\nWhat Is Marriage Different From a Non-Relationship?\n\nBeing a single adult will help determine how much we like our partners.\n\nBut for the general public the difference between a love-based relationship and married couples is not so obvious as it may appear.\n\nEven those who don't own an umbrella may still find their partners annoying.\n\nBut you can do a little less damage on that end; if you partner with people who have different social roles (eg. a parent to a child to a father, a spouse to a child), you can't change what we think we're like together or what we think we can do with our children. If you partner in a married relationship with people who you do not see as your same person, it may be wiser to leave that relationship if you think they are more important to you and what you have for their wellbeing.\n\nIf the two love-oriented couples are together and you don't know which one to match, you will need to consider how long your relationship lasts through it.\n\nIf you partner in a two-spirit relationship (or at least the same level, if you're single) and you are attracted to either an independent \"my,\" or the independent \"my\" as well, it can be okay to change between your two-spirit ways of living just to change our lives.\n\nBut what if someone else wants a more spiritual or creative partner? They could love someone else, or at the very least, you could want an independent and loving partner. In either case, if you do not understand how to get more out of a two-spirit way of living, it will most likely hurt you to know the other spouse wants more than you have.\n\nIf you partner in a two-spirit-oriented relationship, your commitment to each other and your love for your partner makes it harder to get happy.\n\nIt's not that you have to go and change anything, but if you have never been able to adjust to living together, it's time to rethink.\n\nYou'll end up with the very same person who likes you more and who may be more likely to like you, but isn't willing to listen to you. You'll have to make the choice between something else like, \"Okay; I won't buy her any more, but I'll give her anything she desires.\"\n\nYou might feel that even if you were willing to break up with you, you'll still need someone to share your love in order to satisfy your partner's needs. If you don't have that person right now, you'll have to make the choice to change.\n\nThere are people out there who just aren't willing to put up with what they're going through.\n\nYou'll want to hear how much your partner is willing to take care of you and your relationships with other people and with yourself. Don't believe me? Don't be that person. Talk to them.\n\nYou have to take care of yourself.\n\nIt is not enough just to look up to someone for inspiration and advice when you don't know how to be more involved. You know you need to give something back to your partner as well. And by what you give back, you aren't talking about the people you think they like, but the ones you think actually care.\n\nDon't let your partner get you to feel that way. Don't get excited that you can't control the way he or she gives you.\n\nDon't let your relationship be dominated by your love\n\nEven when you disagree with someone who wants the same things, it may be okay to disagree, but it's important to do so with integrity.\n\nYou must always understand that any one who gives them the things they want isn't a perfect person, they are just trying to satisfy themselves, and a lot of it is to be successful as men or women, and even then, not every person is completely as successful.\n\nIt will not always be possible to go over everything that people want to say and do or do not want to say, and there are limits to how many people can get things done.\n\nYou have to treat your partner with care, and it is very important to give him or her advice and guidance on what he or she wants to do, how long they'll be able to work through the obstacles, and what you will do if he or she can't do it.\n\n\nDon", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

They have not only been complicit in it, but have actively been complicit in it with their own complicity for centuries. The war is the only way to end it.\"\n\nZamboanga's lawyers said this week the United States, as much of which is funded by oil and gas companies, should also contribute money to the peace process \"to prevent this genocide.\"\n\nA U.N. Security Council resolution passed in September 2013 by 193-member nations condemned \"the killing of 6 million people in Darfur,\" which amounts to the largest genocide of any country in the world since the 9/11 attacks.\n\nZamboanga said his group had been accused of perpetrating the violence to the point that they were not entitled to return to their homeland, and that they were still suffering.\n\nHe said the U.S. and its allies should \"support the peace process as best they can when confronted with its reality.\"\n\n\"When the United States, to their credit, doesn't act on these claims in public, they can be prosecuted if they are willing to testify about the crimes committed against them, as long as they also say they were not complicit in them,\" Zamboanga said.\n\nThe U.S. has long been the target of criticism following the 2010 killing of five people in Colombia, including two women who, due to their lack of medical care, were given death squads and put on trial in New York before being sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nIn January, President Barack Obama announced that Colombia would launch anti-terrorism measures against Al Qaeda militants and the U.S.-backed Al Nusra Front, the affiliate that has previously been implicated in atrocities against civilians.\n\nThe Obama administration has since sought to counter any U.S. threat against the country, saying that the group's activities, however, violate U.N. Security Council resolutions requiring UN-imposed human rights violations and \"violations\" by armed rebel groups.\n\nAl Nusra, which is considered a designated terrorist group with the U.N. as its most important mission, has also been designated as an \"uncommitted terrorist organization\" under the U.N.'s 1951 Geneva Conventions.", "length": 686, "ended": true}
{"id": 250460, "text": "Towards a unified system, states should be able to require information that is in the public domain, including the contents of data stored by state databases (e.g., public databases and government databases). States would need to know about (theoretically) public information stored by their services, as well as information stored by governmental databases.\n\n\nUnder the current system, states and their respective elected officials could not impose these requirements. As with any state, those requiring information are obligated to comply with this obligation and the state laws will vary by state. For example, some states require the owner to provide the public with a certificate or proof of title (e.g., proof of an organization's ownership) before the state collects any of its data. (For example, Texas requires the state to provide an owner's name and addresses in order to give them in-depth legal documents. (Note that Texas does not require that government entities provide a \"proof of title,\" that is, identity, but rather information of a public entity without such a record.) For other states, state leaders are permitted to require that the person who provides the information may disclose a list of specific individuals, such as individuals in office, that they are legally authorized to access from a private server (i.e., from a mobile phone). (For example, states can prohibit the use of a government database of name and address information to protect the privacy of public servants and citizens. (This list, however, can be used by federal, state or local officials; a more expansive list is available here.) (For more information about the types of data required by state and local law, see here, and here, respectively.)\n\n\nIf information contained in a state-issued list is subject to state or local disclosure under the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the commission will issue a notice stating the circumstances under which federal disclosure of the records exists; however, if no state issue notice is issued, the FCC will not release information to a public agency that seeks the information. (If a list subject to a publicly funded list is used as both a state and an agency, and there is no public agency that will release the public information to a public agency under an agency-funded list, then the public authority would not provide that information to the public authority under a public agency-funded list.)\n\n\nAn organization or individuals should not be forced to make such decisions by submitting a request for data to a state's database. (State's databases in general also need to contain sufficient information to ensure that data is submitted properly and the data used to form the query is accurate.)\n\n\nIf state and local officials refuse to give the public access to an Internet location they believe to be a public entity, they may, under state or local law, have state authorities refuse access to that information and request copies of the data. Information gathered by a state can then be used to establish who is authorized to access it (as demonstrated by public officials' refusal to share information they do not want any public information to reveal). When a person is refused in such a manner because the use of such information was requested for federal government, the request must be made in the form of an affidavit (e.g., a form approved by public authorities such as the attorney general or city council). State law requires local officials to report what information the state wants in relation to a request from the federal government. State officials must inform the federal government.\n\n\nIn states that require such documentation, \"all the information\" in the state's database is required to exist (as in a state's system). State officials and state law enforcement agencies may provide some type of documentation (e.g., court, medical examiner, or other legal or regulatory documents) regarding certain documents. (For information about how this type of information is made available to state officials, see here, and for the information about how the state has managed to develop this information for law enforcement, see here.)\n\n\nAny information provided to a state that it believes, without legal authority, is in compliance with the state's laws or regulations may be used in its own internal capacity. State and local government officials may, in some cases, opt to allow those local officials to access the data, or to refuse such access (for example, if the government refuses to give the data to a general or special purpose website such as a website or a news or opinion site). If so, the information must be available in a legally binding, open and public manner without restriction.\n\n\nA request for information is filed with the FBI and should be served not only in a closed court process but also in a legal-related setting. If not, the information is then not subject to legal process. Information that is provided as an independent or third party to a judge or district attorney, or to a state judicial clerk, is subject to state and local judicial discretion; but a public official may not disclose the information on any occasion, in whole or in part for any reason other than to \"act on\" any requested", "length": 1024, "ended": false}
{"id": 250461, "text": "\nWe do know why he'd want to do the thing in front of so many people: that's what happens when people ask you how many people there are in the neighborhood, and where they live \u2014 and a question that's been asked many times by neighbors in other parts of America. This isn't a big deal: most people are comfortable renting to someone who has lived and worked there. But the reality of these questions may change in a few years as more Americans make the switch from renting to buying their own homes.\n\nA recent study by the Urban Institute found that the average rent for a two-bedroom in New York City is roughly $1.5, compared to $1,974 in Chicago for single-family homes. So if our city's median home prices are not higher, your home may not be worth $400,000.\n\nIn the same survey of 1,000 people, Americans reported a range of rent options for a two-bedroom home, and nearly all did agree that they prefer a three-bedroom home in their own community.\n\nSome people say it's more affordable to own home in New York for the low price of $1,000 up front. Others say it's cheaper overall to rent than to buy. And others say it's more cost-effective to stay a couple, even if you have to pay multiple times higher rents.\n\nIn a similar poll conducted last summer, the American Society of Civil Engineers found that nearly 60 percent of homeowners say they prefer the cheapest option if they want to live there for more money.\n\nSome have also pushed back against those who say that they will not be able to build one at home in their own communities due to lower economic growth. For example, former U.S. Ambassador to Germany, David Remnick, famously said, \"You can't sell, only buy.\"\n\nRelated: What you should know about owning houses\n\nSome are pointing out that even homeowners who are struggling to afford to live in pricey apartments at a time when living standards are high can afford a few years of rent.\n\nOthers are asking how much more affordable you are and whether you're willing to wait to get someone else over. Even better, the survey found that even about 40 percent prefer to leave their home in their own neighborhood, not to move if there isn't a good connection to their home.\n\nRelated: We're not talking about rent or mortgage rates \u2014 Americans are real people and living in a neighborhood is a great place to stay\n\n\nIn a study published on May 28, the Urban Institute found that the average rent for a single family home is $1,907, compared to $1,977 and $1,977 for a two-room home, respectively. That's more than six times as much as it would cost to buy one in Los Angeles.\n\nThe other big question, though, is whether those two-room homes offer adequate value for money.\n\nNew York City, the nation's second capital, is home to about 500,000 people, which is more than twice the population of Los Angeles. Some 6 million residents live in an area about the size of Los Angeles that includes more than 40 cities \u2014 like Long Island, New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., San Diego, Chicago and San Francisco.\n\nSo if you live in one of those cities, you're about to get a lot of problems with an individual's home.", "length": 711, "ended": true}

I was impressed. What better way to introduce someone you're attracted to (and even more so this week) to people than to write and talk to them all about their sexuality.\n\nAnyway, I have heard pretty much all about him since then in the same way some of the other comments have did.\n\nI know that it's going to get pretty heavy-handed. It's going to require some kind of legal situation.

As a gay man, it really isn't a problem.\n\nBut it is a problem for the gay man as seen above and in any other context we should be discussing openly and without any fear because we all know we will be treated differently as an individual.\n\nSo please don't get me wrong! Everyone should have a right to a fair hearing but we should all be looking out for ourselves and our relationships and talking about what we really can do for our partner or the world. We don't need to ask \"Hey, there's something I should know or something I'm really good at?\"\n\nThere are also many other situations where gay people should not feel their sexuality, especially those who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\n\nBut this is really not that big of a deal.

A guy who is going to be a jerk, or who is probably going to break the law or be arrested should not be able to get away with what she is doing, especially in the first place.\n\nB.\n\nDon't ask your friend or friend in a way that you don't think it's going to hurt them.\n\nDon't feel guilty for asking.\n\nDon't feel stupid for asking.\n\nDon't feel threatened by people who are not your friends or allies.\n\nC.\n\nIf the friend or friend doesn't seem to be doing an ok job, don't tell them that.\n\nDon't tell yourself that they're the bad guy who made the call, who doesn't understand what you're doing.\n\nDon't ask for help or anything that might make you feel weird.\n\nD.\n\nDon't leave the situation in your relationship.\n\nDon't say anything or anything that doesn't make you feel really hurt.\n\nDon't tell other people that you should talk to them or to your partner about things you don't like or what they are doing in the relationship.\n\nE.\n\nDon't be angry or jealous at the other person.\n\nDon't be upset about the other person.\n\nDon't try to convince anyone that you are a smart person.\n\nDon't be so stupid that you don't understand what your partner is doing or what you're thinking.\n\nF.\n\nDon't say anything or make a stupid mistake.\n\nDon't take this as an excuse to go back and change things.\n\nA.)\n\nDon't get that other person to come to your house if what you're doing doesn't", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

The court did not rule on the merits of the arguments offered by the ASAG, but did rule that \"the abortion providers were operating within the context of a legal definition of pregnancy when they operated as providers\" with a medical purpose, and \"the law as amended would be not unconstitutional under that definition because it would violate the constitutional limitation of judicial review of statutory construction,\" the ruling said.\n\nFollowing the decision in Friday's hearing, the AIPG, which runs many of the nation's largest and most prominent state-based abortions clinics, posted a statement explaining their decision, calling its decision \"a victory for safe and legal access for state women and an example for the American people,\" saying the decision \"shows that the state courts cannot simply ignore Roe v. Wade in the name of fairness to women or protect the rights of the woman.\"\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n\"This case will likely continue to stand regardless,\" the statement said, adding, \"After careful examination of the language in the statute, it is undisputed that this statute applies broadly.

While there, the woman tried to have an abortion, but the state clinic was unable to determine her child's condition, and the state clinic decided there isn't enough evidence to bring criminal charges of providing safe, legal abortions, and that abortion providers who are \"consent-based\" are too dangerous for a law that could effectively bar them, the appeals court found.

{"id": 250468, "text": "Hannity wrote an email to the editor in the wake of the \"fake news\" story on Saturday, April 6, 2015 and asked her to stop using \"alternative facts\" for her column. She replied, \"You know where I stand on news stories, so why use the \"alternative facts\" when I have all the facts I need?\" I'm sorry for making some of you furious. In an email from my office, I wrote, \"Don't be this angry. I can't control my opinions. But I can make sure that the rest of the news gets to me.\"\n\nDon't look at my email. You are at large here. It's going out to your inbox.\n\nI have to say, though, that I'm also really angry about having to choose between the two things. \"Fake News\" was not just his term for \"fake news,\" it was also, of course, his right hand term. It was the kind of phrase that the left used to mock his presidency and the president's policies like amnesty, immigration reform, the wars on terror, etc., etc., etc., etc. And he and so many of the Republicans who believe that he's making our nation a better place on a day to day basis want a different way.\n\nHannity's use of \"alternative facts\" is in stark contrast to the more-powerful rhetoric of the Left which is to blame for the rise of Trumpism from the right to the left and to the extreme right to the extremities of the left. The left has consistently used this tactic to push candidates like Clinton and Sanders to engage in the most radical policies toward the core of what the left calls the \"fundamentals of capitalism.\" But they're the ones who have taken the worst care not to include such radical ideas in their message because it is so dangerous for anyone to say so and thus undermines the working class's own future as the working class grows older. They also are the ones who want the working class to become the party of their fellow human beings so it's a way for them to have power rather than a way for them to rule over that working class and to become the party of their own.\n\nThere's good reason for this. It's really not what the left wants. It has its worst uses and its least uses. It's basically a cult of individualism that is the product of a corrupt capitalist class and has been a key ingredient of the modern left for generations.\n\nHannity's use of \"alternative facts\" and the other false narratives she generates is an egregious example of these policies. She thinks that the \"alternative facts\" are, in fact, not true and thus are no different than \"alternative facts\" that they're not true. If you don't believe that something is true, and it isn't, you're out of luck. This isn't about whether a particular politician isn't \"racist,\" this is about whether they aren't \"anti-immigrant\" or their political party isn't \"anti-immigrant.\" The only real difference, if you're on the left, is that this is actually about the difference between being a \"leftist\" and a \"rightist\" that you're on the right. You're not only opposing a system based on racial profiling and racism so you are opposing policies based on the need to take an equal shot at getting more people to participate in society as much as possible, but you are also opposing policies based on the need to take more people on board with capitalism.\n\nI find it curious that she wants to try to make these sorts of things look like a \"leftist\" policy in a way that allows her to claim that it's about the left, instead of looking for ways to make politics look like socialism. The difference between being a \"leftist\" and \"rightist\" is that those are the people who should be doing most of the talking about what \"alternative facts\" are. As she said above, that's why people have tried to discredit all of these people to the extent that they're trying to silence them.\n\nShe's not wrong to believe that \"alternative facts\" are a tactic for gaining power. But, if you believe that, the only problem is that they aren't actually true. If you think they're telling the truth about Trump and the future of the American economy, then there's no good reason the American economy should be governed by \"alternative facts.\"\n\nHannity doesn't understand what \"alternative facts\" are or how those facts can be manipulated or manipulated by a powerful oligarchy and its supporters. She doesn't understand that the media is, in fact, biased in their reporting, or that the political media are more biased than ever or that they're the source of many false narratives. The problem with what Hannity and her writers call \"alternate facts\" is that one of their methods is to present a narrative of an unchangeable reality when it's possible to", "length": 1024, "ended": false}
{"id": 250469, "text": "Frequently Asked Questions About The Fondles of Eighty\n\nA few comments regarding the various types of mounts and accessories were made by several people who live near this town, who were asking if they could use a mount or accessory as their primary attachment. Below is a list of their inquiries:\n\nDoes the Fondles of Eighty have a handle that works for me?\n\nWhen I first saw the Fondles on eBay I wasn't sure if they worked on anything because they cost about as much as my Fords. When I came back to their webpage, they were looking for any Fondles from various manufacturers and I was told it was just a list of mounts that were manufactured by many different manufacturers. The reason that they would ask for a list is because they don't have a lot of information about this hobby and they didn't see their Fords until several weeks before they were ordered. The Fondles they sent me are made by two different brands. For most of those people, the main point of the list they used for the purchase was for the price that they were selling. They will offer you the options for what mount they desire but I won't tell you how they did it. I have no idea where they got their Fords. However, even if you got the Fords as a hobby, many people will say it is because of the money they paid for it, as the company is so well known and is known for the quality of their products. The Fondles will not accept any more personal information.\n\nCan I ask for one for any other reason or if I need a spare set?\n\nYes! We will do a full refund. It will take the company two days to determine the time and place to place the Fondles. It will take your order out from them then return it. They will do a full refund for the money spent and that does not have anything to do with the Fords being your order.\n\nHow long will it take until they post the Fondeel set to their website, Facebook page, or email?\n\nIt will take them up to 45 days to post the set, once they do that will take it. This means you will have to wait until you order it. If the shipping is quick and there is a good deal on a set and you do not want the shipping cost to become prohibitive it will take 5 years to collect it. If a lot of people do order the set with a set price then there may be a delay or delay in shipping so if you don't send or receive the set in time you don't even have a chance of your set. If you have a set of mounts you can just send them back to them and they will have the same day of shipping.\n\nCan I send an Fondle after I have bought three Fondles in the same year?\n\nYes. Fondles which are ordered prior to 1/14 are also sold before 1/14.\n\nDo you know of any other websites that make it possible to order a set?\n\nThere are many. If you search for a certain service or an accessory then you can always buy one from the seller. Unfortunately, due to the time it takes to send the Fondles back and get their replacement from the vendor after their package has been shipped out, the vendors will not be able to make the replacement.\n\nAre the Fondles of Eighty available via UPS or CAA to me or someone else, or are they only available for me by email?\n\nThe Fondles of Eighty does not require UPS or CAA to send them home, these are the types of Fondles they sent us for to the buyer and the only person who can tell me where they ordered one from. A UPS and CAA delivery is provided as well unless otherwise stated.\n\nI have a Fondle and I ask them to send me it by the amount they are willing to charge for it and I can send them it through Fondle to the person I asked for. Why?\n\nWe can provide you with an email address when you make your purchase, it will contain only one message. We can only offer you one of our Fonds. Since all those Fondles are purchased together you can be sure there are other people who are willing to sell you Fondles for you.\n\nI have a fondle and I cannot find one that ships to me, what to do?\n\nYou can contact the person listed on the left, or just leave me a message on the Fondle, in this case the email address that we provide. Since you need the money to purchase the Fondle, we will try to send you a replacement Fondle by email.\n\nI received the Fondle before shipment and I receive it with a tracking number (not a postage address) from a mail box, what should I do?\n\nYou can order", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 250473, "text": "\nThere's more to it than \"sophisticated\" food or a \"lack of good taste or general taste\" \u2014 there's actually one problem.\n\nThe most basic human motivation, of course, is greed. That's why I've seen this trend in my own life and why I've always had a hard time coming to terms with the fact that I was wrong about what food truly was. We've all felt like we were wrong, and we never learned from it.\n\nBut if you actually look a lot deeper at what truly matters when it comes to our personal and financial decisions, you'll find what's actually important on every issue.\n\nIn fact, in these parts of the world, and maybe the world more, we're all at risk of making the wrong decision.\n\nA recent study published in The Lancet on the subject found that people who didn't eat enough in food had a higher risk of mental health problems while living in poverty. One-third of all adults who used alcohol were at increased risk, and 1 in 3 of these individuals could have health problems like ADD, which could be linked to high blood pressure or cardiovascular problems. Those who ate too much made up less than one-fourth of the people who didn't and about two-fifths of the people who didn't had cardiovascular risk factors. And more than 95 percent of those in the poorest countries were overweight.\n\nIn fact, according to the latest UN report, a fifth of a global population is underweight, which means that in some places where you're likely to have diabetes, you're at an elevated risk of having severe hypertension.\n\nSo we really need to understand how diets are different, how nutrition is different \u2014 to truly think of these kinds of matters, I think what that means is to look at how food choices actually have an impact on mental health health.\n\nSo what if an individual doesn't eat a good enough diet when at risk of depression? For example, there's a very real risk of depression in the obese, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing for the health. Also, it isn't just the obese, it's what happens to poor people who are obese. So people who need healthy food can go out early in the morning and eat just fine.\n\nSo it really isn't about just how it's healthy to eat, it's not about how it's healthy to eat in a way that is not harmful to your body. So I think there is a way to be compassionate, and I'm interested in being able to work with nutritionists.\n\nAnd so here's another question from the media that we really need to know more about. The way we categorize food seems to be changing. I've already written about it a little bit here, but I thought it was important to look at why those labels aren't so important, especially for folks in rural and urban areas.\n\nFirst of all, when we compare diets across populations, people with obesity, people with type 2 diabetes, or those with high blood pressure make a bigger difference to their mental health than people with low blood pressure. So, if you're eating a high-fat diet, you're really doing more damage to your mental health than those with lower risk \u2014 not just in terms of mental health but also health effects.\n\nSo even if we think we're going to be okay without all the nutrients and all the foods that we consume, then eating less \u2014 because I think that it's safe to be there without all those bad things, or having high blood pressure, is actually not really the best option.", "length": 740, "ended": true}

It's one thing to look at a company that is taking the piss when they sell products that are based not on performance but on the concept of quality. It's quite another thing, when a product that is the product of the most talented, smartest marketing experts comes out and says the same thing about some guy who sells the same product and no one is reading it anymore.\n\nYou know how when you think back to the '90s, there was a small company in South Africa called the 'Bub' that produced some really cool products. It was not so many years after that, as you might imagine, it was in the early early nineties that the company opened. This particular person was a product manager at the time, and he sold a lot of things to people \u2013 in fact, they sold around 100 products a year.\n\nSo, why was it so big?\n\nAt any rate, that's where I'm from, when I was first, I bought more than 50 different products from other places like South Africa to sell to various people. At that point, I'm not sure how big was really small \u2013 I do think a few people really tried it out and tried it at the same time, but because I wasn't really interested in selling them \u2013 I got into something that got me the attention that I wanted to make something.\n\nWhat are the things you would recommend to others?\n\nThere are many things that can apply to other people. But then I got the impression that not everybody in my company had something to offer with these products. I don't think there was ever any need for someone to know all these other things. Not just other people, but everyone. It's hard to sell products from the same organization. It could mean you have a good partner with these companies, which are making all kinds of great product, but they'll probably not share that with their customers. And if they do, it'll make it really hard for them to sell the product, which would be very expensive. So that's what I recommend.\n\nWhat do you hope people who sell products on Kickstarter will see in your product when they have the chance?\n\nPeople who do some good work on Kickstarter have a great way of understanding the Kickstarter process. They can tell in a simple way that this company is offering value for money and there are good projects out there and they won't waste their time and effort trying to go through the whole lot, you know, \"oh let's just make a product here and bring $100 off the wall,\" but then people will learn from your own efforts when they see what their effort is and that they could give away 10 dollars to a good project. And it's also the first time those good people will know to bring their money back.\n\nThat was the biggest tip that you've given people, in terms of getting excited about your product idea. The biggest question that you've mentioned to them that they won't get from that is actually the first question that you'll ask \u2013 the first question that they will not want to get from you. Do you know for sure that that's the point?\n\nI know. I will be happy to tell people that I've found a way to make the Kickstarter more successful. I'll be happy to say for them to put up some money, they won't come up, they won't be able to buy another product, and they'll go to the web instead of buy another product.\n\nIt sounds like the first question they'll be asking is, what do I think is next? Do I think it's going to have a huge impact or do I think it will just become a bit better after just a handful of successful campaigns. I don't see it happening like I did in the past. Just now, you know what? It won't be the same.\n\nThere has been a lot of buzz about the idea of crowdfunding \u2013 because this is a big idea, this is really important, and to really focus on it, that's part of the reason why people are so enthusiastic. But one thing to remember is that there has been a really big increase in the awareness of crowdfunding in the past couple of years, because there's nothing really new, just like the idea of crowdfunding has never really become anything of interest. There hasn't been a huge amount of attention paid to it. And that's certainly something we're all glad to see from the public.\n\nSo why did you decide to start this project?\n\nThis is a way to pay for some stuff. If you don't, then you'll never get any money. If you don't want the money, you will never get anything.

This is not a statistical anomaly. We all know what the results of many\n\nandrogenic studies tell us but they do not tell us whether our decision could be influenced\n\nmore dramatically. These findings should help us better understand the effect of\n\nandrogens in society. Here is a short list of what you should know. 1. Your birth date. While it sounds amazing that a woman can live until she 65, there are a few statistics\n\nthat show you have a higher chance of fertility in the 20s and 30s\n\nthan the average. But there are many other factors that we don't fully understand, too. The women we are talking about are\n\n. Many of these are not even in our studies. So you don't really have to go much further and look to one study for\n\nfacts. In other words, let me give you an average date: March, 1974. For men, that date is July, 1975. And for women, women may be 2-24, so you'll see that your chance of having children in the\n\nfirst two years and having the kids in two years may be higher \u2013 probably, you'll say. And if you're not going to give birth early.\n\n2. Your height. In this article we will focus on 10 reasons why taller people can be pregnant. The height\n\nthat women often appear to have is not considered a problem in any other study. But in another study, we will take them a step further. In our first year of life\n\nwe will learn why they are nearly equal to us in height in the same time period. And then we will explore more important facts about their health in later years. 3. If you are taking birth control right now, you should know that it is not good for your health. It may not be good for you if you do not.\n\n4. Your birth weight. To quote Dr. John Estrada in the famous quote, \"There is nothing in the world better for you than your birth weight.\"\n\nMany of us are in our twenties or thirties and when we are in our twenties or thirties, our birth weight can be about twice as high. And the higher body fat (3%), it would seem that these things may not be important to most people. This also holds for girls.\n\n5. Your risk factor for breast cancer. Breast cancer is a cancer that can affect all of us \u2013 especially those who are in their thirties and thirties and have children who are not a\n\nbaby. And it is very possible that your risk is due to your breast cancer. This means there are more than 100 cancer types and conditions known to affect your\n\nage. So if you do not take any breast cancer supplements or lifestyle changes, consider how well your breast cancer risk could be reduced\n\nif they were all reduced. In the same situation where you need a better quality of life (a diet with healthier\n\nhealthy fats, more exercise, more exercise as well as better body image), it is much more desirable to find a better quality of life, because it means you will be at least more likely to get\n\ndysphoric blood sugar, lower your risk of CVD. You may also notice a decrease in your risk of heart disease,\n\ndiabetes and other diseases.

{"id": 250477, "text": "The next chapter in the evolution of quantum information technologies, a new field called quantum random number generation, will be published January 2 in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nQuantum random numbers take advantage of the nature of their structure to allow for greater precision. And they have been used to prove that information in nature, including superstructures, can be easily made of much more information.\n\n\"This new field of science could have profound practical significance, since it has the potential to produce a quantum quantum internet of information at the speed in the billions of years of our lives,\" says Professor David Sillis, a doctoral student in the Department of Chemistry, and a co-founder of W.H. McAlister's lab. \"It requires unprecedented computing power and the ability to find a solution at an unprecedented rate within very short (quantum) time frames.\"\n\nThe research, titled \"A Quantum Information Society: The Future of Quantum Computing,\" aims to produce a quantum-based quantum electronic database that can be replicated across devices across multiple continents, at once, and digitally. This has long been a challenge for researchers looking to reproduce new information in nature.\n\nIt's no coincidence that quantum information technology, or information storage, is used heavily in the study of quantum computing today: the world is rapidly consuming data and processing it, and in many cases, it can provide the basis for new forms of computing.\n\nFor instance, if it works with the Internet to tell how fast one is going, quantum computers might be able to understand patterns that might go unnoticed. The potential for this kind of quantum computing is very real. In May, MIT physicists identified an algorithm that works with a quantum computer known as \"nearest neighbor quantum computing.\" It is known as the \"nearest neighbor\" algorithm for large-scale quantum computing, a tool that can take advantage of the quantum properties of the information it takes by using techniques from different points in the universe.\n\n\"A quantum computer uses its quantum properties to help you understand how information is stored, the way it is used, and the way it works,\" says Sillis. Researchers are currently working on a system called a random-number generator that aims to build networks of interconnected information storage systems. These may include information storage systems around the world, so-called \"qubit networks,\" or a network of qubits that can communicate with each other to process data over multiple networks.\n\nThis new field of science could have profound practical significance, since it has the potential to produce a quantum quantum internet of information at the speed in the billions of years of our lives\n\nBut in order to replicate quantum information at this speed, in all its formative periods, quantum computers need to be used at the fastest possible rate of change, or \"fast enough\" \u2014 that is, the rate of quantum computing that involves multiple processes at once. As a result, if information is distributed quickly and safely, it is possible to control the rate of computation with virtually no interference or data loss, says Shira Nishimura, a professor of physics at MIT. And that is why we are here.\n\nThe study, Sillis says, opens up a promising avenue for future quantum computation by using a quantum state machine \u2014 a computer that can \"read and understand the world at a very fast rate.\" In such a quantum state machine, a quantum state machine could allow researchers to easily control the speed at which information is stored across a large number of different points, one to one, in a single, specific network of qubits.\n\nSillis says such a system could prove extremely useful to help scientists achieve quantum-scale data storage systems that can accurately describe the properties of the quantum system, such as how rapidly one is transferring information from one point to another. In particular, such systems are capable of reproducing much larger data sets, and can \"drain the swamp of information,\" explains Professor Tsuburaya, a postdoctoral researcher at MIT.\n\n\nThis article tagged under: Quantum, quantum information\n\nQuantum, quantum information", "length": 829, "ended": true}
{"id": 250478, "text": "This review is based on new information published by Dr. Jonathan E. Wojcik, PhD.\n\nIn general, when the food is frozen, the bacteria present are not present in the cells being cooked, which means that they are not present in the actual frozen food. For example, the protein present in egg yolks is not present in the frozen yolks of the egg, because one of the bacteria present in the egg does not form the bacteria-specific Bacteroidetes, or GSH (Bacteroidetes is a bacterial community-wide class of molecules found in bacteria in the body). It is possible that by cutting the fatty tissues with a knife, they would cut off the germinating parts of the cells that produce those bacteria-specific Bacteroidets. If that were the case, the bacteria present in the yolks would have been less likely to be present in the yolk of the egg and the yolks would also have been less likely to be present in the yolk of the egg because they would have produced less bacteria-specific Bacteroidetes and would have been less likely to have been present in the yolk of the egg. This is true for the entire yolk (both the yolk, the yolk itself, and the yolk with which we are working together).\n\n\nIt could also be that the bacteria present in yolk is the result of bacteria-mediated starvation (see below), which is an example of a process whereby some of the bacteria in the yolk become starved of their own DNA and in turn, this process, if it can be described accurately, causes the yolk into a state of 'complete starvation' as mentioned earlier. This could also happen at high concentrations of the bacteria present in the yolk during cooking.\n\nWe now know, for the first time, that, based on our recent observations of the Yolk (Figure 1), some bacteria in the yolk which we have not seen before become completely starved of their own genome (Figure 2), we can observe that their DNA is not completely consumed, although it is possible that the organism is still producing more than was required in the first place. This could be especially so when a large, well-known food shortage occurs.\n\n\nIn addition, for this study the results of the Yolk were collected from our lab for analysis. We collected the samples from a laboratory using commercial, organic, or raw food processing materials (Table 1 in Materials and Methods) rather than processed foods produced in bulk, which is a different topic, but certainly not the one in which the yolk samples were collected. We also collected the yolk and the proteins from a commercial food processing lab or lab to examine their activity on the food. We also collected the yolk and the proteins from a commercial food processing lab using commercially available non-GSH (for example GSH-2G or GSH-1G) proteins, which are present at lower concentrations in the yolk than in raw food processing. It is also clear that the yolk was harvested at different temperatures and temperatures in the lab.\n\n\nTable 1. Summary of Food Ingredients/Sizes In the Yolk (\u03bcmol) (kg) (in)\n\n(in)\n\n\u00b5g (\u03bcmol) (kg) (in)\n\n(\u03bcmol) (kg)\n\n(in)\u00b5g (\u03bcmol) (kg)\n\n\nYolk Preparation\n\nSoybeans were the primary source of the yolk, which was extracted in this laboratory from about 1.1 kg of rice (8 g). Each 1.1 g yolk is then boiled with 50 g of water to produce approximately 30 g of Y-Y-yolk. The Yolk Preparation method and the Yolk Fermentation Method were tested in this lab. The results of this experiment demonstrate that after freezing the entire yolk in a cool, damp environment (60% NaCl), the protein-producing bacteria in the yolk, including the Bacteroidetes of the yolk formed through the fermentation process, were also able to act as a protective factor against the Bacteroidetes from cooking when added to their yolk. One of the characteristics of the bacteria and Y-Y-yolk that became more abundant as the yolk cooled was the fact that the bicarbonate of each yolk incorporated into the yolk was high in a specific form when boiled in the refrigerator which resulted in a high bicarbonate, which allowed for more fermentation of the yolk (Figure 3). Another study has shown that with no yolks present, the bicarbonate of bivalent compounds in the yolk, and in contrast with the control, did not accumulate, and this could have an impact on the Bacteroidetes, for example in some cases which have not yet recovered from a previous fermentation and therefore had to be tested for the Bacteria in their", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

One such car is the GAL, also known as the GAL and GAL-F , that was also named during World War I to commemorate the end of WWII. A GAL or GAL-F was used by civilians on an all-world mission and was used by Allied forces, and it was also given to U.S. soldiers in Iraq.

Go to a store, bring some food and your food's ingredients to get started. For example, some of these are from Chinese restaurants.\n\n2. At the end of each step you should see items you haven't eaten yet. To keep it simple, I usually get a batch of food or items I've been craving.\n\n3. For example, at night, make a cup of tea before going to bed and take that with you.\n\n4. To get started in the morning, add some green and garlic powder to the microwave or a little curry powder after dinner.\n\n5. Finally add some water to the microwave or the microwave and cook the mixture over a high flame for several minutes until smooth.\n\n6. Once the mixture is smooth, cut your vegetables into thin strips that can fit just under the top of the microwave. (If you have one, you can also make a smaller vegetable strip or you can add a few more on top. I've got two small pieces that I've saved for this and you can find all of them at your local organic supermarket)\n\n7. Place a bowl of hot water on top of all the mashed potatoes and the rice. I usually use 1/4 cup, so if yours doesn't have enough, a little extra liquid is good.\n\n8. In the bowl of hot water add some vegetables such as celery, panko, broccoli, carrots and carrots, mix well and add more if necessary.\n\n9. Continue cooking by stirring the milk together to keep it all together so they sit together.\n\n10. The next day, pour some salt on to the potatoes.\n\n11. At this point, add some green peas. Sprinkle with the lime.\n\n12. After the potatoes are ready, add a dash of salt to your pot of hot water a little before you finish the mixture.\n\n13. Place the pot of boiling water with the mixture to a plate. Pour over the cauliflower to drain it. This makes the cauliflower look a bit light.\n\n14. Heat a little butter over medium heat. Then add some milk and bring the soup to a boil again.\n\n15. Once the soup is boiling enough to handle the pot, pour it over the cauliflower and bring it back to a simmer.\n\n16. Remove the cooked vegetable from the water at this point and add half of the green peas.\n\n17. Serve the soup with another spoonful of lemon or lime wedges.\n\nStep 2 - Add More Food, or Take Less to Cook\n\n1. Go to a different store. If you're not sure what is available, go to your local organic grocery store and get it. Then make a cup of tea or water. It doesn't matter if it's a pot of tea or hot water.\n\n2. Put in the fridge.\n\n3. On the back of the fridge, add some vegetables such as celery, peas and onions to the milk mixture and add them to the pot of boiling water. This makes for a little more liquid.\n\n4. Cook more slowly, or add more food if necessary.\n\n5. Add more water to the pot of boiling water before you finish adding the peas and add more if needed. The broth will come down slightly faster and it's easier to boil.\n\n6. Serve it with a dollop of water. Do this while you're at it, or if you want a little more time to cool off. (Keep in mind that I love cooking at 30 degrees Celsius, and my oven only really sets the \"cooler\" down to 65 degrees C if that works for you)\n\n7.

{"id": 250495, "text": "The U.S. military is conducting a covert \"high-altitude air refueling mission\" aboard several U.S. warships along its northernmost coast as part of a larger push to shore up U.S.-led coalition forces. The mission is to monitor the movement of U.S. combat drones across the U.S. Southern Border and to take \"ground control over the aircraft carrier USS Cole,\" which is also a major part of the USS Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe aircraft carrier has been in the process of completing an acquisition deal with Boeing, which is looking to purchase one of the aircraft carriers for the United States Air Force. The U.S. Navy recently announced that the carrier and its four vessels have finished construction of two more carrier groups, the USS Carl Vinson and USS Carl Vinson Black, and are due to go into service when the new year is over.\n\n\"A number of U.S. carriers are being added, including an Air National Guard squadron of the Black, to complement its Navy and Coast Guard forces in the wake of threats of terrorist attacks on homeland,\" the U.S. Air Force Command, citing unspecified information from the military, said.\n\nU.S. military planners are concerned that while the carrier, which is believed to be one of the most heavily armed vessels in the fleet, does not appear to be moving ahead with a carrier strike force, a carrier strike group will be a major source of new U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria, the commander of U.S. Pacific Command said.\n\nThe United States is spending $100 million in military supplies and more than $1 billion of military training in the Northern Syria region for use by the coalition forces for an attack on Islamic State forces, but there are signs that the United States is looking to spend even more in the region. In some cases, the U.S. military is using funds for special operations activities rather than supporting the military. The $6.6 billion cost increases to $90 million over the 2011 fiscal year by 2014, the largest increase in a single year through fiscal year 2008.\n\nThe Navy has been trying to shore up U.S.-led coalition forces under a massive new military-to-military partnership with Boeing. Earlier this year, the Navy and Boeing pledged $5 million each to support the U.S. and coalition forces \"on an ongoing basis, including as a result of ongoing joint operations in the Northern Syria region,\" according to the Pentagon on its website.\n\n\"While this is a significant milestone in joint operations, it is still the last significant engagement to be the focus of future joint operation operations.\"\n\nThe U.S. Air Force, which oversees many of the largest aircraft carriers in the U.S., is also expected to deploy ships in support of military operations against Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria, a significant step for the defense secretary since the U.S. Central Command is said to have been involved with the deal involving the coalition forces.\n\nBoeing will be tasked with constructing two new combat drones capable of tracking aircraft as well as taking off from the carrier in the Northern Syria region. The USS Nimitz-class destroyer would not need to land for these missions, which would be done by a single person, while the Black-class destroyer carries five additional vessels.\n\nThe Obama administration's plan was to use a combination of military forces to combat Islamic State and other terrorist groups. Under the military-to-military partnership with Boeing, the U.S. is expected to buy about 4,500 U.S. aircraft, which the Pentagon is expected to complete by the end of 2013. The U.S. Department of Defense would not say where it will use the aircraft carrier for aircraft maintenance, so one source said military commanders are still evaluating whether a deal would occur.\n\nThe U.S. is in talks with Russia to build a \"landing station\" for the ship. The Trump administration has made clear that the Pentagon is prepared to spend $10 billion over the next 10 years to buy at least 25 new US destroyers. The Trump administration is considering $7 billion for the ship purchase program but has resisted the Navy's order to move the contract up.\n\n\"We have talked with a lot of countries that say: 'Well, we have a long shot,\"'\" a senior U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"We believe there could be a landing station or a long-haul delivery option for this ship.\"", "length": 929, "ended": true}

And yet for most of us, these things are a surprise while we're there. So we figured when the Apple logo goes up, you'll want to stop worrying.\n\nAnd because we can all agree that these things aren't going anywhere, Apple is coming for you as well.\n\nThere are several ways to get Apple's latest phone in your hands, starting at a little more than $99. The cheapest you can get with a second-generation Apple Pencil is $199 for the iPhone, but the third-gen iPhone offers something more affordable.\n\nBut most of us will have to wait while our first year of free service kicks off, a little longer than we expected. So this might not feel like a deal at first, but it works for the long haul.\n\nSo what do the rest of us do next?\n\nIf you have an old Apple Watch, you'll get your first new Macbook Pro next month. But there won't be any Apple products around.\n\nThe other way you get Apple accessories, first-generation Apple Pencils, is Apple Pay, or the company's new online store or store management.\n\nFor an example of how it's working, grab the new iPhone 5S (that's the same as the original one you bought for $399.99, so it's a little more in your pocket) in stores that sell accessories.\n\nThis means that once the second-gen iPhone releases in 2014, your old MacBook won't lose its touch-screen display unless you pay for a new one.\n\nIf you don't mind Apple Pay on a new MacBook or a new iPhone 5S, you can just get one in Apple Home and save 30 percent on your bill.\n\nOn the other hand, you can also pay for a new iPhone 5S in Apple Pay and pay for another $150 for the same phone, which costs $99.99.\n\nHere are a few ways to do that:\n\nYou have to be a registered e-commerce or retail business owner on your old iPad.\n\nYou've heard that you can pay for something with Apple Pay and keep it there.\n\nYou'll want to use an existing iPhone, though Apple may soon support new devices with an optional Apple ID.\n\nYou can purchase your old iPad for a much larger fee if you bought that for $1,599.99 last week. That's more than a year's worth of Apple Pay, it's a \"major leap,\" Apple said.\n\nYou should also check out Apple's new loyalty program as it lets you make purchases with Apple Pay on iOS devices.\n\nSo, if you're a Mac user, you'll be able to use Apple's online store or Apple Pay anytime, anytime, anywhere.\n\nNow what?\n\nFor now, don't worry about this all coming to an end. If it keeps happening as expected by early next year, your iPhone won't have a new device out next week when it should end up hitting the shelves next quarter, and you'll no longer be able to purchase your new Mac. At least not during the current quarter.\n\n\nAnd now, here is the first in a series of features for anyone who would like to get it ASAP.\n\nThe first half of the feature is just for people who want to add a new device for free to their Apple e-commerce service.\n\nSo if you have an original iPad, or even the newest iPhone 5S, this means you can now order a new iPad for 40 percent off from Apple just from e-commerce site Amazon, right here.\n\n\nAnd here's the second half for those folks who want to add a new device for free to their Apple e-commerce service in the future. Apple already has a feature called \"payday,\" if you're a paid e-commerce user.\n\nYou can now pick up your old Mac right here, but if you're a paid e-commerce customer today, you'll have to wait a little while before any of those new products arrive.\n\n\nHere's where you get to choose what e-commerce site you want to use first, if you want.\n\nIt's hard to say what each would work on today's device, but they do work for what you get in e-commerce.\n\nAll of us might agree that Apple's new iPad will make the most of the new Apple Pencil. But how many people would buy the new iPad, a lot less than it cost to buy it the first time around?\n\nBut for right now, this means all those devices won't have to worry about your new Mac buying on Amazon for $199 for the new device. So, with that one device, it's actually getting cheaper.\n\nThe best iPhone 5-S", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

Buchanan, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation Law Center, a think-tank in Washington.\n\nBuchanan noted that while Roe v. Wade remains popular across the nation, the high court has not yet taken a stance on the legality of the abortion. He said this is not a case that \"has come out of the blue\" because Planned Parenthood v. Casey was decided on March 8, even though the Texas district court had overturned a March 8 lower court decision that had struck down the abortion rights bill in Texas in 2010. That case was decided on March 2.\n\n\"The case that we have now is the fourth one in the record,\" Buchanan said.\n\nThe 5-3 majority will hear oral arguments from both sides on the decision on Thursday.

Morgan, who made the comment after the other two were discussing how to fix the city's emergency shelters, said the third and fourth were \"not really interested.\"\n\nMorgan said he was only speaking off the cuff because the homeless don't pay their rent anymore. A spokesman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said that while it was \"the right thing to do.\"\n\n\"The administration made clear it opposes a $17-billion-a-year shelter system that makes no money for their homeless tenants,\" Schneiderman said in a statement. \"However, the housing department will support the development and renovation of the housing system, while helping build a stable housing market for homeless or low-income households within the city limits.\"\n\nHe said city leaders are \"still committed to getting help to the very hardest people in the city, but now that we're taking the next step into a comprehensive effort to ensure people receive the relief they deserve, we'll be holding them down for as long as we can until something is done to help them get the help they need and deserve.\"\n\nAfter that, Morgan explained that the city has already approved about $10 billion in new funding for local government, and he's determined the homeless should be funded right where they are.\n\nWhile they may think twice when they hear that they'll be homeless for 20 years, Morgan said that when he heard one homeless woman told him how grateful she was to the city for the money she's received for her home\u2014it was only when she asked him questions what about his homeless clients that he felt compelled to talk about them.\n\n\"I just didn't listen to the other stuff that I was given,\" Morgan recalled. \"This was the first time that I talked about them.

Frank McCrory, Mr. McCrory's deputy chief of staff with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. I asked him what he was doing at HUD. He responded, \"I work under Mr. McCrory at the BWI.\"\n\n\"And you are a senior policy adviser for the President's inaugural ceremony?\" I asked. \"Yes, sir.\" Mr. McCrory replied in a tone of genuine curiosity. \"And what does that mean?\"\n\n\"It means that you get a job in the Federal bureaucracy and you work closely with our office, with our chief of staff and staff at HHS, because you are the person leading a senior team,\" the deputy chief of staff responded.\n\n\"I'm a senior policy adviser for the President's inaugural ceremony,\" said I, in jesting. \"And you're a senior policy adviser for the President's inaugural ceremony. What does that mean?\"\n\n\"Well, it means you get a job at HHS and you are part of a senior team,\" he replied. \"And you can now join our Senior Development team.\"\n\nThere are no words of his in the speech. He was talking about three important points. First, all three people are working within the department; they belong to one of the three offices; and these three people are also acting under the direction of one of the three senior staff.\n\nSecond, that senior team is already involved in all the projects that Mr. McCrory is leading. This includes providing the federal government's most sensitive projects with the assistance of the Office of Management and Budget staff.\n\nThird, the senior staff's roles and responsibilities are very broad. All three staff are being assisted by HHS and other agencies and through the private industry.\n\nNow imagine, for a moment, a situation where two senior staffs and one office were working in different offices or divisions of this building. When that senior staffs began working together at HHS, at what point does that senior staff get their job? In what way?\n\nLet's look at it as a metaphor. Suppose that the second deputy chief of staff is a secretary or director of the Office of Management and Budget. If the first deputy chief of staff was serving in an office in a department, which would be the case if he was working for the administration, but there were three other different offices that had to be in this building that had to be located all along. Would that lead to an additional four people working in the department when McCrory's second senior staff was also serving?\n\nNow imagine, for a moment, two senior staffs and one office were at HHS. How would that work out?\n\nThey must have worked in different office and division, but I would imagine that they had to be a second official of the Office of Management and Budget as well. This is an interesting point. Imagine, for a moment, an administrative unit of a department in which three senior staffs are working at different offices and divisions. This includes working with the State Department's Office of Strategic Services, coordinating the Administration's projects on a budget basis, coordinating our work on health care, and coordinating our work with HHS.\n\nThe two senior staffs\u2014Mr. McCrory, Mr. McCrory's first deputy chief of staff\u2014would have to be working together at HHS if they were at all working on the same mission. How would they do that in the State Department?\n\nThere is no legal, legal requirement, which allows them to be so. A government employee has only three career choices: they can pursue the mission he wants, they can go home\u2014or go to work in order to have a fulfilling career as a policy advisor. It's very difficult, I think, for a third career choice to be able to go to work when the job is important to them and to have more time to study in order to have more time to live and enjoy life.\n\nOn the other hand, two senior staffs would be at HHS right now working at the same office/division. In all three instances, a senior staff of a department would have to be working across the entire building.\n\nOf course, this is a very complicated scenario by which to understand why the president's first inaugural is celebrated so intensely in the media. How can it be that, in the same breath, the president himself will be speaking to his people?\n\nThe first executive order he signed in January is the kind of action that many people, regardless of their political leanings, would take, particularly in a situation where two major parts of a department have to be completely separate and completely interlinked together, and the president has made his inauguration a one-day event, on his own initiative; where you have a major event at the city government meeting a day before he makes it to the Oval Office.

In the ensuing incident, Parnell is a member of \"the Racist American Family Project,\" which promotes white supremacy and hate crime by portraying all black people as subhuman and un-American. Jamey Parnell spent six years in jail (of which he spent at least $200,000) for killing a white man. His family told The Washington Post, \"We thought it was a good guy for the record.\" On Wednesday, Parnell said he was arrested for a crime of violence.\n\nIt wasn't exactly an easy sentence. He was booked into the Kansas City jail with 5.25 years for the manslaughter manslaughter. He was sentenced to 5.25 years in prison. But after the trial, the judge declared Parnell innocent of the charge. Parnell was also ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation. The judge also told Parnell that he was being told the reason he committed the killing was because of a \"genuine physical, mental, and physical addiction\"\u2014and Parnell went out of his way to prove it.\n\nBut how wrong many jurors were. The jury, though, was white. The trial ended with Parnell pleading guilty to murder and going to jail for six months for violating probation. The judge said the trial was \"inadmissible.\" His punishment for killing Jamey Parnell was five months in jail, but the judge told Parnell that if the family would sue, \"we would be able to send them a copy of the jury instruction,\" to which he responded, \"They can't see it at that stage, you know, so they can just take a picture and let that dust settle.\" When the family filed for bankruptcy, Parnell was told he was out of jail, and was no longer allowed to have any of his property put on display.\n\n\"We were forced to leave our house and go to an off-campus library and our friend would give us money to stay late for dinner,\" Parnell's niece, Sarah Parnell, told CNN.\n\nThe family went to the city attorney's office and found that Parnell had filed a $60,000 civil rights lawsuit and that the city was also suing for discrimination. In October 2008, the attorney said he had filed \"in the best interest of justice\" if Parnell committed the murder. She also said Parnell was not entitled to compensation. A judge also found that he had an obligation to pay restitution to victims of the shooting. Since then, Parnell has been arrested on three or four felony counts in connection with the murders. One of those cases involved a white man, Kenneth Anderson, killed by a black man who was trying to kill his daughter while riding in a white pickup truck. He also had a conviction in a misdemeanor vehicular homicide and was sentenced to two years probation.\n\nBut he hasn't returned to jail or paid the $50,000 in restitution. In January 2009, Anderson's family announced that Parnell would soon appear on the case of Jason Loy. Anderson killed Loy's 13-year-old daughter after two males in a white pickup truck drove up behind him. Authorities found a plastic bag on Anderson and found Parnell. But the police got very ill. They then used a sting to find Parnell.\n\nParnell's parents sued Anderson's family, but the case was dismissed. But Parnell was never charged with murder. \"The court was very clear in its ruling,\" Sarah Parnell, who was the mother of Anderson before Anderson died, told HuffPost, \"that the jury was properly awarded damages for Jamey's death.\" So, the family now wants a jury of the kind they've had for so long.\n\nThe Parnell family isn't alone in protesting the lack of any proof that Parnell committed the murder. Jamey's father, Tom Parnell Sr., told WAVY that he's been in touch with his son as much as possible, and that he isn't sure if they need the proof. \"Every year when I go to school I feel my kid is going through some stuff that they were all too familiar with and they're getting lost or being taken elsewhere. I think I've had some good experiences with a lot of students with an experience like that, but that the process of coming through it hasn't been as good.\"\n\nSome of today's high school boys who would likely struggle might struggle with this situation. One girl, Jennifer Lee, 23, said, \"If you're going to go to college with a girl like that, there's a better way. We don't think they should be locked up by law enforcement.\" Another high school student\u2014who also claims to be Jamey Parn", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

The public-facing digital download website that eventually gave him his name was renamed The Pirate Bay in November of 2016.\n\nDotcom's goal for The Pirate Bay was to provide free, peer-to-peer file sharing sites \"for everyone,\" as revealed by a public consultation session held on Reddit in May.\n\nBut the digital piracy community quickly developed into an online war for control over the internet's contents as Dotcom started a series of torrent-delivery sites, which also offered free, peer-to-peer download and other services. They began taking off in 2013, bringing Dotcom the attention of copyright holders in Europe.\n\nAfter Dotcom's death, a number of companies began to form, including Digital Currency Group (DMG), the maker of the bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash wallets, that would become known as The Pirate Bay.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pirate Bay also had its own website that promised \"the ultimate censorship.\" The group's website advertised \"a free and open platform with full anonymity that will allow you to browse in safe, secure and peer-to-peer mode all over the Internet.\"\n\nThe Pirate Bay also took a page out of the copyright-protecting system created by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, saying that \"all content and services are now available in the public domain in full and transparent transparency and that this is a right that everyone needs.\"\n\nAccording to its website, the Pirate Bay is still open but \"we continue to develop features to offer you a much more secure, anonymous and decentralized experience on the Internet.\"\n\nIn October of last year, The Pirate Bay said it had sold its domain to Viacom for \u20ac3.8 million, making it the largest private Internet service provider of its ilk in the world, and setting the record for the largest online streaming portal in the world: Facebook.\n\nThe two companies have been partners and they made similar moves over the years and it remains unclear how well the Pirate Bay can hold off on selling its domain.\n\nA previous deal with Viacom was to buy the domain, but the deal was never signed up by an entity named the Internet Group.

My parents left home at 5 o'clock with two children.\n\nThe parents left their daughter at home with some friends.\n\nAll day, the phone rang on the door. I could heard the screams of the living room that had been broken open by the fire outside. When the phone rang again, it was the girl's dad. He was gone.\n\nI remembered the screams. The child I'd been crying my entire life. I remember her crying for a minute. I'd told her to open her ears and go to sleep. But she told her mum and sister.\n\nAfter some more calls from my parents, I walked to my room, and closed the door.\n\nI opened it.\n\nInside was this: [A] note. We had made up. For a year, we'd known each other, and had talked through each other with almost total disregard. The only way someone would tell we were friends for 15 years, even if we'd never known one another for 15 years, was if she'd been kidnapped by the same person who took her. She couldn't be that way.\n\nAfter the next day's phone calls were made and she was home, she begged for help \u2013 and asked if I would go to see my boyfriend.\n\nI told her I had a boyfriend, and that we would go together. Within the next 3 hours, he'd come to my house, and we'd found our first date and she had gone for a bit in the living room. But we hadn't met in person. The night before we found each other at home with our parents, we ran to her room, and woke her up in bed. I went to her room, which was at the end of the main road, to get some sleep.\n\nThis was the last time we met for the first time. We'd just been together in October, and I wasn't sure where we'd go but wanted to ask.\n\nSo, we went for a hike back to our house. She was there with my older boy and the two of us, and I was there with the other girl as well. As I was putting this up, I had the other girl tell me she'd gotten into some sort of fight with the girl I'd gotten with, and we went back to our bedroom to find that she was now lying on the bed, alone, with her little face still on her pillow. She had a bruise on her back, and just like that, I saw her.\n\nIt was at this moment it started to get cold here in the living room. The next day, I had my husband, who was in town with us, call me. I told him I could't come if we didn't see each other, and we could't go at home until he told Dad I'd find out about it.\n\nHe didn't know what to do, and just as we were getting into our second car, something grabbed me, pulling me into the car, and grabbing our hands. I ran towards the door. It said we were alone, and I was scared to say that, but I jumped inside the car, jumped back in, and then I got there when the door creaked open, and that's when it hurt.\n\nA few minutes later, I woke up and found myself at my boyfriend's door. He's gone, apparently, on an adventure, and he tried to go over to my bed. After I told him that he should wait, before we went out for a walk, he said, \"Go into your bedroom, and try and make love to him \u2013 you're doing it right now.\"\n\nI just shook my head, and went upstairs to meet my boyfriend. He tried to help, but couldn't because he was so scared. I called the police, who called me back, but he didn't see us until we got home. I had to drive him to the hospital, because he hadn't shown up yet to see me. The police took him to the hospital, but I didn't have that chance, so they waited for two weeks for me to come home. That's why I was so worried that he might be shot. Then came the next morning when the police called, and the next day a new man came in, and he tried to shoot myself.\n\nAt this point you can call the hospital now, because it's your hospital that he's gone to, but you can call the police yourself when you want. When I finally got an ambulance service on the scene, I said, \"This must have happened,\" and the doctor, who I knew before the ambulance arrived, was on the way to the hospital.\n\nI've been very grateful to those I met through the years, and my children, who will look ahead to adulthood.

The best of the week should be your choice. A list that can last you until retirement time and you don't have to get up on the sofa as often as possible.\n\nThe best of the week will be for you that you get the opportunity to pick your own time schedule that will last. I think about this all the time and I don't get why it isn't a good idea to pick a day in the future to go to work, but I also don't get why people take to using the same days just for that reason. You do have that luxury of staying home and hanging out with your family, and I think you should think about why this is especially important to you. If any of your friends or family use a day off, if they go out and get some snacks, if they take a break, if you want to work with the people in the office, would you rather stay home and wait for the people to change their schedules, or would you rather get to your home for awhile knowing they aren't coming away with that much time to rest? Is time worth it? I think I'm going to have a choice of what days to stay home and what not to take.\n\nI don't mean that this is a bad thing for you. The reason I do it is because I always love a good time and I love the freedom of taking my time as I see fit. And that is why I give myself some great freedom in the summer. I have good reasons to go out and spend time with friends, family, and all that jazz. That just makes me more productive in the future. But I think it will take awhile because sometimes I have to do some planning to get back to where I want to go.\n\nThere is a good old saying on the internet that has been used as a way of putting people down when they aren't in an abusive relationship:\n\nIt's always about time.\n\nThe good news is that I don't have to decide how I want this to go at all. It just takes you back to the days of the \"best ever\" and you realize what it means to be successful. This idea of not being good enough for the world is just how you manage to get there.

I was into gaming at the time and I had a good job but I kept wanting to try other things like computer games but it just wasn't something I couldn't enjoy and play myself. Luckily for me, I started working on a new hobby, so I didn't have much money to do anything but for me it was awesome to get back into gaming and to try something new. As a result I decided to make something my own. I found my first ever website, Gamabots, and started a monthly gaming tournament called Gamabots where I won a lot of cash prizes. I had some really cool games in there like:\n\nIn the spring of 2002 I was invited to try out a game called Riptide. It was a fun, fast, and competitive game so I thought, \"Wow, maybe I can make another game.\" So it was one of the first games I played in a while. It was a cool way to win money so I decided to put it to use.\n\nI spent most of the month of March on the streets of Vancouver, BC. At first it was a really empty-ass place, and the only person who could show me how much money I had, and how much I could do well. As it turned out at first it was the most busy day of my life as I could not find anyone to get around to making my money. Eventually I just went at it and started playing. I knew I was going to get into game design, but in order to create this kind of game I needed to know people. So I created an application that could give you a list of all the people that I had helped make with the game.\n\nI was very excited to create and create something, and when I looked more closely I saw that it took my imagination to do so, but when I ran into all kinds of things, it was just amazing to see just how good it was. There wasn't a lot of money to spend. When I found out that I'd help the developers I was ecstatic and was blown away. I knew there had been a lot of things I had done. I was happy I had helped so much and I was excited to do more than how much money I had now. All I was feeling at the time was a complete confidence in myself. I knew I could make any game I wanted and there really wasn't a reason to put it out, but I was blown away because I didn't want to wait to play the game. It was fun, and I enjoyed playing it.\n\nMy last game before I went broke was The Dark Tower, so for me that was one of the most memorable games of my life and also one of the best games of my life.

And then this was the sauce.\"\n\nThe bartender added \"there was no way I would have it go over like a regular cheese.\"\n\n\"I would make an individual order as a minimum and let her know that if she didn't order something because the cheese was too spicy, I'd take everything out,\" the bartender told WTVJ 10. \"Then I would use as much of the cheese on top of that as possible, just like I would make an order of a special sauce, as I see that kind of food that I know so well.\"\n\nO'Brien said he ordered the pizza because he was scared of getting into trouble in the heat of the moment.\n\n\"I don't know if there was actually someone else who's been around to make it and had to order it,\" he explained.\n\nO'Brien added the customers were not very interested in the cheese because they didn't like the taste or appearance of the sauce.\n\n\"We were really happy,\" he said. \"We weren't concerned. So we wanted to make it to them.\"\n\nO'Brien said a customer told him there was an employee standing nearby that didn't want her to order anything. He ordered the pizza with her and made plans to order a large slice of the crust.\n\n\"If you're in their mood,\" she explained, she wouldn't stop eating the pizza.\n\n\"What is good is that it works for the employees,\" O'Brien continued. \"They say it's good for them as well, and I think that's why it gets all kinds of customers.\"\n\nThe lawsuit claims the bar was told to \"unfairly\" place the dish on the plate and that one of its employees had to provide some of the \"service\" by providing the cheese.\n\nThe lawsuit asserts that the ingredients included the \"meat cheese, sauce, cheese, pickles and sour cream.\"\n\nThe barista said she never made the sauce before, but that she did make the cheese last week when her husband and their daughter came to buy and enjoy a slice of the pizza.\n\nThe lawsuit notes the two employees didn't know there was a legal problem and were trying to contact police over the dish.\n\nIn 2010, the restaurant's owner resigned after being accused of defrauding customers. He resigned in 2016 after two previous restaurant managers complained that his employees didn't take part in the lawsuit.\n\nThe Sun Sentinel was unable to reach O'Brien for comment.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2015 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

{"id": 250519, "text": "I found this to be quite informative. I had to take two pictures to bring my story to this point. I am trying to share the information I have because there are a lot of people out there. If I didn't know what I had in mind, I wouldn't have picked this subject up.\n\nAfter looking for some data, I came up with these numbers. I can't explain them all at this point. I've used Excel and PowerPoint extensively and have had to use them both, with each in addition to the other using the same method of data collection.\n\nSo, I have created a spreadsheet containing my data. The spreadsheet is labeled for the month but the title was printed in the first part. The first line shows what I found in the study section and describes the data.\n\nTo make the data I generated, I simply add all information in. If I found anything interesting, I could look into it but I've got many, many times to find that. (See: \"How to Analyze Data in Excel\" by Dave Smith.)\n\nI went ahead and added in the year or year in which the study was published. So I started with a year when I was young so I might as well be 18. But the study published in 2014 was published in 2004, and was published by the European Academy of Sciences. This gave me a good idea of what I wanted to know.\n\nI went and added data from 2014 to see if things got better. Again, it was an extremely long study.\n\nI checked out the following data for the first 20 days when I was researching the results. It is the data from 2011 to the present.\n\nIt is interesting and is important to remember that the results I have in this article were generated by the journal of the World Economic Forum. If you don't have any information about the study, this is a guide to follow.\n\nHere is the full spreadsheet:\n\n[pdf link]\n\nIt shows some surprising results. It shows it had been conducted in Europe before the European Union, so we can call it a surprise when it didn't do much. It is one of the most important countries in the world, and I want to know about how the data worked for the rest of the world.\n\nHere is a graph showing the results. I started with a baseline and then added in the number of days of the year.\n\nWhat it shows is that the European Union had a much warmer and less positive relationship with global temperature data (which can be the result of lack of data). A lot of scientists say that, but if the data in this paper was going to show that, then this could be one reason the data showed this warming.\n\nBut here is why I would love to know if the data has been shown to help us.\n\nLet me give you a bit of what I discovered during checking out the study. First, they show the effect of summer temperatures on average temperatures in different parts of the world. In the case of the UK, summer temperatures was far worse in those parts.\n\nThis is why I had to work out what they were showing. I decided to look into the issue with the study methodology.\n\nWhat I found is that the only data that they really found was from 2007\u20132007 (at their conclusion), and with many other data points.\n\nSo I did the same calculation again and the same result (which is a good approximation of the data).\n\nNow the researchers on the site had some other interesting results on the same data that were obtained by the study as well, but they were in the wrong place.\n\nFor instance, on that data table, the researchers found in 2008 that a drop in summer temperatures would tend to have a stronger effect than an increase in winter temperatures.\n\nThe same thing would happen with the data in this study. For example, the difference between those summer days and winter days would be more pronounced.\n\nThey are wrong here. The drop in summers in the US from 2007\u20132007 was mostly caused by cold and snow. But in 2008, it was due to the cooling in the US due to a rise in snow accumulation. And they are the same for those two variables (winter versus summer) \u2013 no difference there. If the data was right, then there would be a more pronounced effect in those two variables.\n\nFor instance, in 2007 they found that the drop in summer temperatures in the US was about 1.7 mm. And the decline in summer temperatures in the UK was not 2 mm. So they may have found a similar effect on the data and they would have found a statistically weaker effect if they had used it differently.\n\nAs I explained in the comments, it does not necessarily mean that the data is wrong or that the data is \"fake\". It just means that I don't know the data.\n\nFor the rest, I tried to figure this out in a paper I wrote and will be", "length": 1024, "ended": false}
{"id": 250520, "text": "For many people, being the wife or partner of a big or medium-sized business has been a time of yearning \u2014 after all, is it a good time to share your family's finances?\n\nBut to those of you who are like me and have been working for years, that could not be further from the truth: the time comes for marriage and family. At the same time, it is also imperative that the marriage and family structure continue to evolve and remain stable. We are living in a new era, one in which everyone feels entitled to their own financial autonomy, as well as freedom to choose their marriage or partner.\n\nMany people, in particular young men and women have found happiness and stability in their marriage. They are able to feel their family and their finances while working in the corporate world and, by the way, enjoy a very low interest rate rate on assets. These men and women feel that their marriage should be a safe bet for working, working families, and for their community.\n\nHowever, we also need to acknowledge that marriage doesn't mean living off of one's family income. Even for those of us who have family incomes of less than $12,000 a year, that is only part of the equation.\n\nBut if we aren't being generous with what we earn, then maybe we should do something about it\u2026\n\nTake away the family and focus on the business of investing in marriage and family.\n\nIt is very important that we invest in the business of making sure that we invest a lot of time into family businesses instead of simply working hard.\n\nWe need to make sure we take the time to see a woman or a man for years and months of time with their relationships, children, families, health care and other assets. We need to spend that time to pay the bills, move our cars, pay the bills \u2014 and we need to take a serious look at the future, and make all of our own decisions with that in mind.\n\nTake away the family, and focus on the business of investing in marriage and family.\n\nWith this thought in mind, there is a solution. A new website that gives you clear-cut financial advice on how to build financial stability and financial independence. This website includes some helpful links for all of our readers who are looking for advice as well.\n\nThe Money Matters website is a new online business called Money Matters. You can find what your potential partners, partners, family and employers really want to hear about and how to help you make sure you have the financial security you need.\n\nYou'll find these valuable sources included by the Money Matters Business section on our homepage as well as other related content you may find helpful.\n\nMoney Matters makes it simple for anyone to manage their own finances.\n\nYou simply enter your home address, credit card number, mortgage payment and other financial details, including:\n\nYour name, date and address (optional), your current balance between the mortgage and your credit card (optional), the number of months of your loan and your new credit score\n\nThe exact amount the lender is offering for each of your services\n\nThe amount of money you have on hand if you are making a purchase to pay with your mortgage (optional), and\n\nAmount of each credit card you hold to pay your loan (optional)\n\nThe exact terms and conditions of each loan, including the terms and conditions in effect with respect to any transaction\n\nWe also have additional links for those interested in checking out a new business or getting a quick overview on what your options are.\n\nCheck out Money Matters on our homepage as well.\n\nSo to keep these important financial decisions in mind, let's talk about the way we value our family.\n\nHow we love our family\n\nTo put it simply: our family comes first and it is our job to provide for them. It is not a matter for the business owner to do and it is not a matter for anyone to profit from for this family. Our family is our own. Family is our love.\n\nFor over 25 years, our family has always been the best value for money. We've always loved, cherished, and worked for your home, your life and your community \u2013 so we're proud to say that our family is the single most important part of our home life. And if that does not come easy\u2026 well, there is a simpler way. We have a very personal relationship with our family and are proud of the values they put into our lives.\n\nWe spend our time learning from each other and getting through our differences (and ultimately being happy together, too). We enjoy growing up, learning from each other and giving a lot to each other (even if these days, as we say, is hard, too). We enjoy being with friends, spending our free time at our most interesting, having a blast from our comfort zone and having fun growing up. We also share the joy to have new or exciting opportunities in life and", "length": 1024, "ended": false}
{"id": 250521, "text": "There are a lot of ways they could have been defeated, but in this tournament, the results look pretty convincing.\n\nGretzky vs. Maksim Lv.1\n\nGretzky has an impressive first half of 2017. He's won four straight games, has earned a point in two of the last four tournaments he's played against, has a record of 6-1 against the likes of Umeda, St-Empower, and the Netherlands.\n\nKreibin has an impressive first two weeks, taking away three of those against SK Gaming, and has had a good start to his undefeated run, but has suffered a massive injury in the early stages of the tournament.\n\nAfter struggling in the first two weeks, it looks like a strong start to the 2016-2017 split.\n\nReid vs. Dae Hyun\n\nLast season, R2 have shown a strong performance, as evidenced by the fact that he and Kim Dong-hyeong are the only non-StarCraft 2 players to qualify for the 2017 World Championship. It's only natural that one of the most successful seasons for R2, and the one that will likely continue into 2018 as well, would be seen as a blowout.\n\nReid was one of the best players in the world at his team debut, with several years at Worlds, before landing a role in the North American scene. Since then, it was hard to think of a better option heading into 2018.\n\nIn his three year career having won five major events, and playing in every major tournament of his career, he's still had a strong run in this tournament. He's also won a huge amount of points in the past two LANs, but his points streak, in the past five tournaments, has ended abruptly. This time around, it seems that he's managed to make it back to the World Championship.\n\nKraig vs. Stenging\n\nIn a match between the two most popular players in the European scene, Kraig is undefeated in both worlds this year. Stenging has had a very good weekend, making him a favorite to win this one, and having some solid matches like the one he did against GomTV and TAC in the WCS World Championship.\n\nAnother player that is likely to lose in this map pool, is Draven. He's a solid performer at the moment, but not to the level that he used to be. In 2013, he took the loss of Smeb, but didn't win anything close to the level of some of his peers.\n\nIn the past four years, Draven has made himself a favorite to win this map pool. In the last two LANs, he's lost the three most important games of his career in the group stage between DreamHack and GomTV, and he's been a fantastic example of an elite player at the moment.\n\nJax has been a very successful pro player, and this tournament he has put in excellent performance. Even though he's had a lot of problems, he's already won the tournament in two of the next seven, and could be able to break some records in the future if he continues to improve his performance and play with his former team.\n\nA bit of a different guy, with better production in the past, and perhaps even better results from his new team, Draven looks pretty impressive. He's played a lot of games in DreamHack and GomTV this year, and has even won some key rounds like the one he did at Worlds. It looks like the fact that he's now playing with a new team will help his chances go up in the upcoming tournaments. This will be one of the first tournaments he plays against a new team.\n\nVile vs. Lina\n\nIn the past four maps in this tournament, Vile has been in the team pool. In 2014, he won two World Championships at a tournament that went to MVP. In 2015, his team was in the team pool, and he won one major.\n\nLina has been in the bottom 8 of this map pool for six games this year, having come in as the favorite to win. She has already beaten every player that could have happened against her, and she's playing in the top 8 of a major tournament.\n\nVile has won a significant amount of victories with the best of them, having won 3 of 6 against Taeja and 2 of 4 against Lina. They've actually not even shown any signs of fatigue during these three months thus far in the season. It just keeps making him look stronger. This will be one of the last maps he'll play against a new team. He just needs some consistency, and can use that to his advantage.\n\nWilly vs. Nal\n\nFor the second time in as many weeks, we will see one of the best performances in the group stage. In 2013, it was no surprise that N", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

{"id": 250523, "text": "\"They need money. They need people to buy it.\"\n\n-\n\nSo how did the story end? It was over for me on Tuesday, on the afternoon of Wednesday my third date, and I was told about the story by another friend, who claimed that two of her boyfriends had contacted her.\n\nThe story said the two were \"fishing with young girls, in a remote town\" that \"could never come across an appropriate place\" to go.\n\n\"We had been fishing since 10pm. I asked him what it was like, he confirmed it was a boat that had just left for the city and I found it to be a really lovely place,\" I told him. His wife and two boys went in search of me the following morning.\n\n\"After we had finished eating we decided to head home to stay there for an extended time of time to relax.\"\n\nFor now, I had to wait a few minutes, and found him at my house in the village of Kharidin at about 3am on March 12. As expected, there we met a big group of young men, with some dressed in brightly coloured jackets - in the village of Kharidin, one of these boys was named Abdul-Karim, and one was named Abdul-Adalil.\n\nThere the two boys had decided to go in search of each other on their own, and it was one of the reasons why both they and their girls, while still alive, had made their way to the village.\n\nOn the way Abdul-Karim had tried to lure me through a small garden where his two girls had gone into the village's fields, and he had come down with a broken glass of wine to my aid. I asked where he was and he explained that his wife and two boys had just bought a new boat, and it had been taken to a village by villagers who had set up tents. One of the men had been killed and Abdul-Karim had fled and had stayed away from me with his companions, and so it was clear that they had gone to a very remote place to get some food for themselves.\n\nAnd so while my husband went with his friends to find, and take away food for himself, both girls told him they were there to give the children and their family a chance to live.\n\nFor Abdul-Karim, though, the two girls had found it a very different story. They said that they did not know him at all, but they had taken a taxi to the village to pick up the people and had arrived in a village on the edge of the lake, where a nearby river was carrying them off to.\n\nOnce again we were taken to the village of Kharidin, where they had had been staying to take the children home. They went to the house and saw Abdul-Adalil standing looking quite happy. He told them how he had been fishing and how he had a child of his own, and said he knew he was not fit to take a wife to his home, that his brother had already died, that some strange thing had been happening to him.\n\nThe children and family started crying and begged everyone to give them back their old boats and return them to their villages as soon as they could, although I did not have the ability to find any of their mothers or brothers and didn't understand what exactly had happened and how to get them to back at the farm, so it was hard for me to be there, and also to get to know the children who had been taken away and were still missing, until I finally got to Kharidin, where the two girls, with their children, and Abdul-Karim and their husbands, were being taken to the village by a woman named Hida al-Nahajah. She had told them about the boat they were taking for Abdul-Karim, and he had gone to the village after getting his children back.\n\nAbdul-Adalil told me over and over again that he had asked if she knew what it was like for him to have a wife and children - and when she replied \"yes\" he came up and told her what happened. He had told her that he knew that his home was in a remote area, and that if any thing were going to help those things to get them to safety, then let himself have some rest.\n\nThen, for the first time during the week, I received a call from Abdul-Adalil. He told me that she had recently been given a letter telling her that in her opinion being married to a stranger was not a man's right to take away a wife who she had loved for so long.\n\nAnd when I told him she had asked herself, as I had before, if this was a decision she could give to her husband, he replied with a shrug.\n\nHe had told her that in fact the men's boat that had been taken was just like", "length": 1024, "ended": false}

The Great Depression is now the most dangerous and most tragic of all periods of American history for thousands of American workers. And while there are many reasons that Americans are not always able to get to the front of that war effort, there aren't any reasons why those people don't have them.\n\nThe Depression began for the most part on the backs of the people who had been fighting against these men for generations. But it was because that people did not know that they were fighting for free and fair wages.\n\nFor example, most of these young men and women who had been the primary fighting men in the War on Poverty were working for the corporations, as you call it in the United States or at least of the other 20 countries. They were part of the very well-organized labor movement, many of them were part of the unions, and they were part of the very successful unions that we had to fight a union fight for in this nation. And they saw this as an opportunity\u2014you know, you see how important the right to a decent life for the working man was for these people's lives, and they thought that the idea of a \"war on poverty,\" where the people took care of it themselves, for the working man, was not working well for them.\n\nNot because the government took care of it any more. They just wanted to keep things so they would continue to work. They had the means to go to war.\n\nIf you were a business owner in a business, you would do everything you could to support yourself before you ever had a chance to get out. And then the system was like the whole idea of being a slave, which was something very little human beings had to live out, and that they had their own separate kind of life that they were allowed to go through.\n\nNow that I have said that, because it is so simple in American history, it is so simple now in so many other countries, if we are going to fight against fascism and communism, we have to fight for the most basic of rights that any single individual or family could possibly have. If you were living under fascism or communist rule, you had to have a right to a fair income. If you were living under communism, you had to have a right to a decent and safe living arrangement. If you had this right and you didn't take advantage of it, you were going to starve. And if capitalism were to make a mockery of all these rights, they are going to make you, if you were living under communism, in a difficult situation.\n\nThe very rich know how to survive. They can tell you how best to work, how to stay alive, what to do when there isn't a job available. But on the other hand, to survive and keep going out, on an easy day, on an easy boat, on a farm with no money and without money there is no life, the only thing to do, the only thing to do is to go fishing, to have something and try to survive, because that's what the working man would do.\n\nSome of these people, like Joe Biden, they're not going to go to war. But there are a lot of other people, like Senator Harry Reid, who are not going to fight for them, because they know they have only about a month, two months, to try to get back to their families, to their jobs, their children, to earn and to work. So these kind of extreme left-wing people have nothing to lose by having to fight this war on the backs of the workers.\n\nThe American people, when they get to war, are going to look very different, very different, because all this money and all the money that goes into wars now is money that the rich are not able to afford. And they are going to look different because they are going to be able to survive on the backs of people who, over the next 10 to 15 years, are going to be unable to buy or work and be able to", "length": 1024, "ended": false}
{"id": 250529, "text": "A U.S. court in Miami had ordered the police chief to drop the charge of child abuse after the girl told an investigator for the Miami Herald on Wednesday that she gave birth to their son \"uninvited\". The girl told the investigator that, after a failed adoption at a Miami adoption agency called Mercy, she had a child conceived using what she told police officers as a \"preliminary finding\"; the name was a reference to a child conceived at the same adoption agency under suspicion of incest.\n\nSPONSORED\n\nProsecutors had not filed suit against the boy's adoption agency, however, as there were conflicting reports on whether the girl's name matched the names of other mothers who gave birth during that time.\n\nA judge ordered Wednesday that the girl remain locked up and ordered the family to pay restitution in addition to the child and keep a list of the names she gave birth to.\n\nAfter the girl's attorney contacted the Sun Sentinel about her name, she was granted a temporary restraining order for the next hearing Wednesday in Miami's Juvenile Court, an appointment to which she had no access.\n\nThe girl's parents had initially refused to participate in the court proceeding, but a magistrate, who reviewed the girl's record, ordered them to appear and provide \"evidence that, despite having given consent before, she consented to and accepted what she said was child support\".\n\nOn Wednesday, the Guardian reported that the girl had called the adoption agency and offered an alternative for adoption services after \"shaming the agency for not being helpful\", because she was \"feared by all of us who are women\".\n\nHer mother told the Guardian that the girl was \"very scared of police\", and that she feared losing her rights and that \"people might think she's an innocent girl\".\n\n\"I had nothing against them. I am shocked by the way that they have treated her,\" said Mary L. Spitzer, the daughter's mother.\n\nL.Spitzer said she believed the police department had been complicit in the abuse and that it refused to investigate and prosecute the girl. But she also said that the girl could feel guilty because of her age, and that she had \"something she couldn't control\" she was not ready to express.\n\n\"She had a very difficult process to go through to get him to come to the county's office and give him back to them, and she had a very strange experience,\" she said.\n\nSpitzer said the adoption agency's director, Jim S. Wilson, told her she was to have her child raised by her mother, \"a little woman that had been adopted by a man that had a very big heart.\"\n\n\nFollowing police interview, an Orlando police sergeant, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Guardian that officers had interviewed several people for the story, including the mother who told police that the adoptive father was at the clinic and that the boy's birth \"shook her\", according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe investigation into the girl's birth comes as the court was re-opened to face allegations of child sex abuse, which have been investigated by US children's rights groups, the United Nations and the International Labour Organization.\n\nLast week the United Nations called on international agencies to investigate claims that child trafficking in the United States \u2013 and trafficking in women \u2013 in 2016 was increasing.", "length": 684, "ended": true}
